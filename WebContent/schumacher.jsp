			<TD>In the early hours on Monday morning, the final race of the 2003 FIA Formula-1 World Championship will begin. Michael Schumacher is favorite to win the Championship, due to his strong position in the Championship. Michael has 92 points to 
Kimi&nbsp;Räikkönen's 83. Therefore, to only way to prevent Michael Schumacher from winning his sixths world championship, is for Kimi to win the race, and Michael to finish 9th or below. Clearly, the best way to ensure Michael doesn't finish 8th or better, is to prevent him from finishing at all. This is my campaign to &quot;Make Schumacher Crash&quot;!<BR>

			<BR>The above statement is not opinion, is not a smear campaign, but a fact. Don't believe me? Ask the FIA. In 1997, Michael went into the final race of the season one point ahead of championship rival Jacques Villeneuve. When Villeneuve attempted to pass Schumacher for the lead of the race, Schumacher deliberatly turned his car into the side of Jacques in an attempt to put them both out of the race, and in turn, win himself his third world championship. The attempt failed, Michael retired, and Jacques Villeneuve went on to become the 1997 Formula one world champion. The FIA recognised Michael's cheating, and the records will show that Michael Schumacher scored zero points in the 1997 world championship, having all his points taken away for his attempt to cheat.</TD>

			In 1994, an identical situation occured going into the final race. This time it was between Damon Hill and Michael Schuamcher both going for their first World Championship. Watch the video to the left. Michael makes a mistake, and hits the wall. When Damon tries to pass, he turns his car into Damon, putting them both out of the race, thus giving Michael a very undeserved first World Championship.</TD>

			<BR>Well, I'm going for the Uri Geller approach here. We need to make Michael Schumacher crash in Suzuka. It's happened before. Remember Silverstone in 1999? Over 100,000 British fans booing at once, and what happens? Two broken legs! So, on Sunday morning, everyone get up, watch the race live on itv, get yourself voodoo Ferrari. Stick pins in a Bridgestone tyre. do <I>anything</I>! Together, we can <B>MAKE SCHUMACHER CRASH!</B></TD>
