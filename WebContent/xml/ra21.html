<strong>I</strong>
Wish either my father or my mother, or indeed both of them, as they were in duty both equally bound to it, had minded what they were about when they begot me; had they duly consider'd how much depended upon what they were then doing;---that not only the production of a rational Being was concern'd in it, but that possibly the happy formation and temperature of his body,

<ps>perhaps his genius and the very cast of his mind;---and, for aught they knew to the contrary, even the fortunes of his whole house might take their turn from the humours and dispositions which were then uppermost: </ps>

---Had they duly weighed and considered all this, and proceeded accordingly,---I am verily persuaded I should have made a quite different figure in the world, from that, in which the reader is likely to see me. 
--- Believe me, good folks, this is not so inconsiderable a thing as many of you may think it;---you have all, I dare say, heard of the animal spirits, as how they are transfused from father to son, &amp;c. &amp;c.--- and a great deal to that purpose: 

<ps>---Well, you may take my word, that nine parts in ten of a man's sense or his nonsense, his successes and miscarriages in this world depend upon their motions and activity, </ps>

<ps>and the different tracks and trains you put them into, so that when they are once set a going, whether right or wrong, 'tis not a halfpenny matter,---away they go cluttering like hey-go-mad; and by treading the same steps over and over again, they presently make a road of it, as plain and as smooth as a garden-walk, which, when they are once used to, the Devil himself sometimes shall not be able to drive them off it. </ps>

---Then, positively, there is nothing in the question, that I can see, either good or bad. 

---Then let me tell you, Sir, it was a very unseasonable question at least,---because it scattered and dispersed the animal spirits, whose business it was to have escorted and gone hand-in-hand with the
<em>HOMUNCULUS,</em>
and conducted him safe to the place destined for his reception.

<p>

The

Sir, in how-ever low and ludicrous a light he may appear, in this age of levity, to the eye of folly or prejudice:---to the eye of reason in scientifick research, he stands confess'd--- a

who, by the bye, have the most enlarged understandings, (their souls being inversely as their enquiries) shew us incontestably, That the

</ps>

---That he consists, as we do, of skin, hair, fat, flesh, veins, arteries, ligaments, nerves, cartileges, bones, marrow, brains, glands, genitals, humours, and articulations;---is a Being of as much activity,---and, in all senses of the word, as much and as truly our fellow-creature as my Lord Chancellor of England.

---He may be benefited, he may be injured,---he may obtain redress; ---in a word, he has all the claims and rights of humanity, which

</p> 
<p>
Now, dear Sir, what if any accident had befallen him in his way alone?--- or that, thro' terror of it, natural to so young a traveller, my little gentleman had got to his journey's end miserably spent;---his muscular strength and virility worn down to a thread;---his own animal spirits ruffled beyond description, ---and that in this sad disorder'd state of nerves, he had laid down a prey to sudden starts, or a series of melancholy dreams and fancies for nine long, long months together. 
---I tremble to think what a foundation had been laid for a thousand weaknesses both of body and mind, which no skill of the physician or the philosopher could ever afterwards have set thoroughly to rights.

I was begot in the night, betwixt the first

in the month of

in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and eighteen.

I am positive I was. 
---But how I came to be so very particular in my account of a thing which happened before I was born, is owing to another small anecdote known only in our own family, but now made publick for the better clearing up this point.

<ps>one of the most regular men in every thing he did, whether 'twas matter of business, or matter of amusement, that ever lived. </ps>


As a small specimen of this extreme exactness of his, to which he was in truth a slave,---he had made it a rule for many years of his life,---on the first
<em>Sunday night</em>
of every month throughout the whole year,---as certain as ever the
<em>Sunday night</em>
came,---to wind up a large house-clock which we had standing upon the back-stairs head, with his own hands:


<ps>
---And being somewhere between fifty and sixty years of age, at the time I have been speaking of,---he had likewise gradually brought some other little family concernments to the same period, in order, as he would often say to my uncle
<em>Toby,</em>
to get them all out of the way at one time, and be no more plagued

<br>

<ps>and pester'd with them the rest of the month. </ps>


</p> 
<p>

It was attended but with one misfortune, which, in a great measure, fell upon myself, and the effects of which I fear I shall carry with me to my grave; namely, that, from an unhappy association of ideas which have no connection in nature, it so fell out at length, that my poor mother could never hear the said clock wound up,---but the thoughts of some other things unavoidably popp'd into her head,---
<em>&amp; vice vers&acirc;</em>
:---which strange combination of ideas, the sagacious
<em>Locke,</em>
who certainly understood the nature of these things better than most men, affirms to have produced more wry actions than all other sources of prejudice whatsoever.

<p>

Now it appears, by a memorandum in my father's pocket-book, which now lies upon the table, "That on
<em>Lady-Day,</em>
which was on the 25th of the same month in which I date my geniture,---my father set out upon his journey to
<em>London</em>
with my eldest brother
<em>Bobby,</em>
to fix him at
<em>Westminster</em>
school;" and, as it appears from the same authority, "That he did not get down to his wife and family till the
<em>second week</em>
in
<em>May</em>
following,"---it brings the thing almost to a certainty.

However, what follows in the beginning of the next chapter puts it beyond all possibility of doubt. 
</p>

---But pray, Sir, What was your father doing all
<em>December,---January,</em>
and

?

---Why, Madam,---he was all that time afflicted with a Sciatica.

<strong>In</strong>
the same village where my father and my mother dwelt, dwelt also a thin, upright, motherly, notable, good old body of a midwife, who, with the help of a little plain good sense, and some years full employment in her business, in which she had all along trusted little to her own efforts, and a great deal to those of dame nature,---had acquired, in her way, no small degree of reputation in the world;---by which word

<ps>---She had been left it, seems, a widow in great distress, with three or four small children, in her forty-seventh year; and as she was at that time a person of decent carriage,---grave deportment, ---a woman moreover of few words, and withall an object of compassion, whose distress and silence under it call'd out the louder for a friendly lift: the wife of the parson of the parish was touch'd with pity; and having often lamented an inconvenience, to which her husband's flock had for many years been exposed, inasmuch, as there was no such thing as a midwife, of any kind or degree </ps>

As no woman thereabouts was better qualified to execute the plan she had formed than herself, the Gentlewoman very charitably undertook it; and having great influence over the female part of the parish, she found no difficulty in effecting it to the utmost of her wishes.

<strong>Hobby-Horses</strong>

---But the truth is,---I am not a wise man;---and besides am a mortal of so little consequence in the world, it is not much matter what I do; so I seldom fret or fume at all about it: 

<ps>Nor does it much disturb my rest when I see such great Lords and tall Personages as hereafter follow;---such, for instance, as my Lord A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, and so on, all of a row, mounted upon their several horses;---some with large stirrups, getting on in a more grave and sober pace;---others on the contrary, tuck'd up to their very chins, with whips across </ps>

---Every author has a way of his own, in bringing his points to bear;---for my own part, as I hate chaffering and higgling for a few guineas in a dark entry;---I resolved within myself, from the very beginning, to deal squarely and openly with your Great Folks in this affair, and try whether I should not come off the better by it. 
</p> 
<p>


<ps>If therefore there is any one Duke, Marquis, Earl, Viscount, or Baron, in these his Majesty's dominions, who stands in need of a tight, genteel dedication, and whom the above will suit, (for by the bye, unless it suits in some degree, I will not part with it)---it is much at his service for fifty guineas;---which </ps>

<strong>Whatever</strong>
degree of small merit, the act of benignity in favour of the midwife, might justly claim, or in whom that claim truly rested,---at first sight seems not very material to this history;---certain however it was, that the gentlewoman, the parson's wife, did run away at that time with the whole of it:


<ps>And yet, for my life, I cannot help thinking but that the parson himself, </ps>

<br>

<ps>tho' he had not the good fortune to hit upon the design first,---yet, as he heartily concurred in it the moment it was laid before him, and as heartily parted with his money to carry it into execution, had a claim to some share of it,---if not to a full half of whatever honour was due to it. </ps>


</p> 
<p>
The world at that time was pleased to determine the matter otherwise. 
</p> 
<p>
Lay down the book, and I will allow you half a day to give a probable guess at the grounds of this procedure. 
</p> 
<p>


<ps>Be it known then, that, for about five years before the date of the midwife's licence, of which you have had so circumstantial an account,---the parson we have to do with, had made himself a </ps>

country-talk by a breach of all decorum, which he had committed against himself, his station, and his office;---and that was, in never appearing better, or otherwise mounted, than upon a lean, sorry, jack-ass of a horse, value about one pound fifteen shillings; who, to shorten all description of him, was full brother to
<em>Rosinante,</em>
as far as similitude congenial could make him; for he answered his description to a hair-breadth in every thing,---except that I do not remember 'tis any where said, that
<em>Rosinante</em>
was broken winded; and that, moreover,
<em>Rosinante,</em>
as is the happiness of most
<em>Spanish</em>
horses, fat or lean,---was undoubtedly a horse at all points.
</ps>


</p> 
<p>


<ps>
I know very well that the

horse was a horse of chaste deportment, which may have given grounds for a

<br>

<ps>contrary opinion: </ps>


But it is as certain at the same time, that
<em>Rosinante's</em>
continency (as may be demonstrated from the adventure of the
<em>Yanguesian</em>
carriers) proceeded from no bodily defect or cause whatsoever, but from the temperance and orderly current of his blood.

---And let me tell you, Madam, there is a great deal of very good chastity in the world, in behalf of which you could not say more for your life. 
</p> 
<p>

Let that be as it may, as my purpose is to do exact justice to every creature brought upon the stage of this dramatic work,---I could not stifle this distinction in favour of Don
<em>Quixote's</em>
horse;---in all other points the parson's horse, I say, was just such another,---for he was as lean, and as lank, and as sorry a jade, as
<strong>Humility</strong>
herself could have bestrided.

<br>

<p>

In the estimation of here and there a man of weak judgment, it was greatly in the parson's power to have helped the figure of this horse of his,---for he was master of a very handsome demi-peak'd saddle, quilted on the seat with green plush, garnished with a double row of silver-headed studs, and a noble pair of shining brass stirrups, with a housing altogether suitable, of grey superfine cloth, with an edging of black lace, terminating in a deep, black, silk fringe,
<em>poudr&egrave; d'or,</em>
---all which he had purchased in the pride and prime of his life, together with a grand embossed bridle, ornamented at all points as it should be.


<ps>---But not caring to banter his beast, he had hung all these up behind his study door;---and, in lieu of them, had seriously befitted him with just such a bridle and such </ps>

<br>

<ps>a saddle, as the figure and value of such a steed might well and truly deserve. </ps>


</p> 
<p>
In the several sallies about his parish, and in the neighbouring visits to the gentry who lived around him,---you will easily comprehend, that the parson, so appointed, would both hear and see enough to keep his philosophy from rusting. 
To speak the truth, he never could enter a village, but he caught the attention of both old and young. 

<ps>---Labour stood still as he pass'd,---the bucket hung suspended in the middle of the well,---the spinning-wheel forgot its round,---even chuck-farthing and shuffle-cap themselves stood gaping till he had got out of sight; and as his movement was not of the quickest, he had generally time enough upon his hands to make his observations,---to hear </ps>

<br>

<ps>the groans of the serious,---and the laughter of the light-hearted;---all which he bore with excellent tranquility. </ps>

---His character was,---he loved a jest in his heart---and as he saw himself in the true point of ridicule, he would say, he could not be angry with others for seeing him in a light, in which he so strongly saw himself: 
So that to his friends, who knew his foible was not the love of money, and who therefore made the less scruple in bantering the extravagance of his humour,---instead of giving the true cause,---he chose rather to join in the laugh against himself; and as he never carried one single ounce of flesh upon his own bones, being altogether as spare a figure as his beast,---he would sometimes insist upon it, that the horse was as good as the rider deserved;---that they were, centaur-like,---both of a piece.

<ps>times, and in other moods, when his spirits were above the temptation of false wit,---he would say, he found himself going off fast in a consumption; and, with great gravity, would pretend, he could not bear the sight of a fat horse without a dejection of heart, and a sensible alteration in his pulse; and that he had made choice of the lean one he rode upon, not only to keep himself in countenance, but in spirits. </ps>


</p> 
<p>


<ps>
At different times he would give fifty humourous and opposite reasons for riding a meek-spirited jade of a broken-winded horse, preferably to one of mettle; ---for on such a one he could sit mechanically, and meditate as delightfully
<em>de vanitate mundi et fug&acirc; s&aelig;culi,</em>
as with the advantage of a death's head before him;---that, in all other exercitations, he

<ps>could spend his time, as he rode slowly along,---to as much account as in his study;---that he could draw up an argument in his sermon,---or a hole in his breeches, as steadily on the one as in the other;---that brisk trotting and slow argumentation, like wit and judgment, were two incompatible movements. </ps>

---But that upon his steed---he could unite and reconcile every thing,---he could compose his sermon,---he could compose his cough,---and, in case nature gave a call that way, he could likewise compose himself to sleep. 
---In short, the parson upon such encounters would assign any cause, but the true cause,---and he withheld the true one, only out of a nicety of temper, because he thought it did honour to him.

<p>
But the truth of the story was as follows: 
In the first years of this gentleman's life, and about the time when the superb saddle and bridle were purchased by him, it had been his manner, or vanity, or call it what you will,---to run into the opposite extream. 

<ps>---In the language of the county where he dwelt, he was said to have loved a good horse, and generally had one of the best in the whole parish standing in his stable always ready for saddling; and as the nearest midwife, as I told you, did not live nearer to the village than seven miles, and in a vile country,---it so fell out that the poor gentleman was scarce a whole week together without some piteous application for his beast; and as he was not an unkind-hearted man, and every case was more pressing and more distressful than the last,---as much as he loved his beast, </ps>


<br>
<br>
<small><font color="red">

<br>
<a href="/displayFigure.do?id=tsv1p050.tif"><img style="border:1px solid #000" alt="View Figure" src="/thumbnails/tn_tsv1p050.gif"></a>
<br>

<ps>he had never a heart to refuse him; the upshot of which was generally this, that his horse was either clapp'd, or spavin'd, or greaz'd;---or he was twitter-bon'd, or broken-winded, or something, in short, or other had befallen him which would let him carry no flesh;---so that he had every nine or ten months a bad horse to get rid of,---and a good horse to purchase in his stead. </ps>


</p> 
<p>


<ps>
What the loss in such a balance might amount to,
<em>communibus annis,</em>
I would leave to a special jury of sufferers in the same traffic, to determine;---but let it be what it would, the honest gentleman bore it for many years without a murmur, till at length, by repeated ill accidents of the kind, he found it necessary to take the thing under consideration; and upon weighing the whole, and summing it up
</ps>


<br>

<br>
<a href="/displayFigure.do?id=tsv1p051.tif"><img style="border:1px solid #000" alt="View Figure" src="/thumbnails/tn_tsv1p051.gif"></a>
<br>

<ps>in his mind, he found it not only disproportion'd to his other expences, but withall so heavy an article in itself, as to disable him from any other act of generosity in his parish: </ps>

Besides this he considered, that with half the sum thus galloped away, he could do ten times as much good;---and what still weighed more with him than all other considerations put together, was this, that it confined all his charity into one particular channel, and where, as he fancied, it was the least wanted, namely, to the child-bearing and child-getting part of his parish; reserving nothing for the impotent, ---nothing for the aged,---nothing for the many comfortless scenes he was hourly called forth to visit, where poverty, and sickness, and affliction dwelt together.

<br>

<p>
For these reasons he resolved to discontinue the expence; and there appeared but two possible ways to extricate him clearly out of it;---and these were, either to make it an irrevocable law never more to lend his steed upon any application whatever,---or else be content to ride the last poor devil, such as they had made him, with all his aches and infirmities, to the very end of the chapter. 
</p> 
<p>
As he dreaded his own constancy in the first,---he very chearfully betook himself to the second; and tho' he could very well have explain'd it, as I said, to his honour,---yet, for that very reason, he had a spirit above it; choosing rather to bear the contempt of his enemies, and the laughter of his friends, than undergo the pain of telling a story, which might seem a panegyric upon himself.

I have the highest idea of the spiritual and refined sentiments of this reverend gentleman, from this single stroke in his character, which I think comes up to any of the honest refinements of the peerless knight of
<em>La Mancha,</em>
whom, by the bye, with all his follies, I love more, and would actually have gone further to have paid a visit to, than the greatest hero of antiquity.

</p> 
<p>
But this is not the moral of my story: 
The thing I had in view was to shew the temper of the world in the whole of this affair. 
---For you must know, that so long as this explanation would have done the parson credit,---the devil a soul could find it out,---I suppose his enemies would not, and that his friends could not.

About ten years ago this gentleman had the good fortune to be made entirely easy upon that score,---it being just so long since he left his parish,---and the whole world at the same time behind him,---and stands accountable to a judge of whom he will have no cause to complain.

---Has this been owing to the pride, or to the shame of the respective proprietors? 
---In honest truth, I think, sometimes to the one, and sometimes to the other, just as the temptation has wrought.

</p> 
<p>

This evil had been sufficiently fenced against by the prudent care of the
<em>Yorick's</em>
family, and their religious preservation of these records I quote, which do further inform us, That the family was originally of
<em>Danish</em>
extraction, and had been transplanted into
<em>England</em>
as early as in the reign of
<em>Horwendillus,</em>
king of
<em>Denmark,</em>
in whose court it seems, an ancestor of this Mr.
<em>Yorick's,</em>
and from whom he was lineally descended, held a considerable post to the day of his death.


<ps>Of what nature this considerable post was, this record saith not;---it only adds, That; for near two centuries, it had been totally </ps>

<br>

<ps>abolished as altogether unnecessary, not only in that court, but in every other court of the Christian world. </ps>


</p> 
<p>

It has often come into my head, that this post could be no other than that of the king's chief Jester;---and that
<em>Hamlet's Yorick,</em>
in our
<em>Shakespear,</em>
many of whose plays, you know, are founded upon authenticated facts,---was certainly the very man.

</p> 
<p>

I have not the time to look into
<em>Saxo-Grammaticus's Danish</em>
history, to know the certainty of this;---but if you have leisure, and can easily get at the book, you may do it full as well yourself.

and of which original journey perform'd by us two, a most delectable narrative will be given in the progress of this work.
</ps>



<ps>I had just time, I say, and that was all, to prove the truth of an observation made by a long sojourner in that country;--- namely, "That nature was neither very lavish, nor was she very stingy in her gifts of genius and capacity to its inhabitants; ---but, like a discreet parent, was moderately kind to them all; observing such an equal tenor in the distribution of her favours, as to bring them, in those points, pretty near to a level with each other; so that you will meet with few instances in that kingdom of refin'd parts; but a great deal of good plain houshold understanding amongst all ranks of </ps>

<ps>people, of which every body has a share;" which is, I think, very right. </ps>


</p> 
<p>
With us, you see, the case is quite different;---we are all ups and downs in this matter;---you are a great genius;--- or 'tis fifty to one, Sir, you are a great dunce and a blockhead;---not that there is a total want of intermediate steps,--- no,---we are not so irregular as that comes to;---but the two extremes are more common, and in a greater degree in this unsettled island, where nature, in her gifts and dispositions of this kind, is most whimsical and capricious; fortune herself not being more so in the bequest of her goods and chattels than she. 
</p> 
<p>


<ps>
This is all that ever stagger'd my faith in regard to
<em>Yorick's</em>
extraction, who, by what I can remember of him, and by all

the accounts I could ever get of him, seem'd not to have had one single drop of
<em>Danish</em>
blood in his whole crasis; in nine hundred years, it might possibly have all run out:
</ps>

---I will not philosophize one moment with you about it; for happen how it would, the fact was this: 

---That instead of that cold phlegm and exact regularity of sense and humours, you would have look'd for, in one so extracted; ---he was, on the contrary, as mercurial and sublimated a composition,--- as heteroclite a creature in all his declensions; ---with as much life and whim, and
<em>gait&eacute; de coeur</em>
about him, as the kindliest climate could have engendered and put together.


<ps>
With all this sail, poor
<em>Yorick</em>
carried not one ounce of ballast; he was utterly unpractised in the world; and, at the age of twenty-six, knew just about as well how to steer his course

So that upon his first setting out, the brisk gale of his spirits, as you will imagine, ran him foul ten times in a day of some body's tackling; and as the grave and more slow-paced were oftenest in his way,---you may likewise imagine, 'twas with such he had generally the ill luck to get the most entangled. 

For aught I know there might be some mixture of unlucky wit at the bottom of such
<em>Fracas</em>
:


<ps>
---For, to speak the truth,
<em>Yorick</em>
had an invincible dislike and opposition in his nature to gravity; ---not to gravity as such;---for where gravity was wanted, he would be the most grave or serious of mortal men for days and weeks together;---but he was an enemy to the affectation of it, and declared open war against it, only as it appeared a cloak for ignorance, or for

<br>

<ps>folly; and then, whenever it fell in his way, however sheltered and protected, he seldom gave it much quarter. </ps>


</p> 
<p>
Sometimes, in his wild way of talking, he would say, That gravity was an errant scoundrel; and he would add,---of the most dangerous kind too,---because a sly one; and that, he verily believed, more honest, well-meaning people were bubbled out of their goods and money by it in one twelve-month, than by pocket-picking and shop-lifting in seven. 

<ps>In the naked temper which a merry heart discovered, he would say, There was no danger,---but to itself:---whereas the very essence of gravity was design, and consequently deceit;---'twas a taught trick to gain credit of the world for more sense and knowledge than a man was worth; and that, with all its pretensions,---it was </ps>

no better, but often worse, than what a

wit had long ago defined it,---
<em>viz. A mysterious carriage of the body to cover the defects of the mind</em>
;---which definition of gravity,
<em>Yorick,</em>
with great imprudence, would say, deserved to be wrote in letters of gold.
</ps>


</p> 
<p>
But, in plain truth, he was a man unhackneyed and unpractised in the world, and was altogether as indiscreet and foolish on every other subject of discourse where policy is wont to impress restraint. 

<ps>

<em>Yorick</em>
had no impression but one, and that was what arose from the nature of the deed spoken of; which impression he would usually translate into plain
<em>English</em>
without any periphrasis,---and too oft without much distinction of either personage, time, or place;---so that when mention was made of a pitiful or an

--- And as his comments had usually the ill fate to be terminated either in a
<em>bon mot,</em>
or to be enliven'd throughout with some drollery or humour of expression, it gave wings to
<em>Yorick's</em>
indiscretion.

In a word, tho' he never sought, yet, at the same time, as he seldom shun'd occasions of saying what came uppermost, and without much ceremony;---he had but too many temptations in life, of scattering his wit and his humour,---his gibes and his jests about him.

<strong>The</strong>
<em>Mortgager</em>
and

differ the one from the other, not more in length of purse, than the
<em>Jester</em>
and
<em>Jest&eacute;e</em>
do, in that of memory.


But in this the comparison between them runs, as the scholiasts call it, upon all-four; which, by the bye, is upon one or two legs more, than some of the best of

can pretend to;---namely, That the one raises a sum and the other a laugh at your expence, and think no more about it.

<p>

As the reader (for I hate your
<em>ifs</em>
) has a thorough knowledge of human nature, I need not say more to satisfy him, that my Hero could not go on at this rate without some slight experience of these incidental mementos.


<ps>
To speak the truth, he had wantonly involved himself in a multitude of small book-debts of this stamp, which, notwithstanding
<em>Eugenius's</em>
frequent advice, he too much disregarded; thinking, that as not one of them was contracted thro' any malignancy; ---but, on the contrary, from an

To which
<em>Yorick,</em>
with his usual carelessness of heart, would as often answer with a pshaw!---and if the subject was started in the fields,---with a hop, skip, and a jump, at the end of it; but if close pent up in the social chimney corner, where the culprit was barricado'd in, with a table and a couple of arm chairs, and could not so readily fly off in a tangent,---

<em>Yorick</em>
scarce ever heard this sad vaticination of his destiny read over to him, but with a tear stealing from his eye, and a promissory look attending it, that he was resolved, for the time to come, to ride his tit with more sobriety.


---But, alas, too late!---a grand confederacy, with

at the head of it, was form'd before the first prediction of it.


---The whole plan of the attack, just as
<em>Eugenius</em>
had foreboded, was put in execution all at once,---with so little mercy on the side of the allies,---and so little suspicion in
<em>Yorick,</em>
of what was carrying on against him,---that when he thought, good easy man! full surely preferment was o'ripening,---they had smote his root, and then he fell, as many a worthy man had fallen before him.

<em>Yorick,</em>
however, fought it out with all imaginable gallantry for some time; till, over-power'd by numbers, and worn out at length by the calamities of the war,---but more so, by the ungenerous manner in which it was carried on,---he threw down the sword; and though he kept up his spirits in appearance to the last,---he died, nevertheless, as was generally thought, quite broken hearted.

<p>

What inclined
<em>Eugenius</em>
to the same opinion, was as follows:

<p>

A few hours before

breath'd his last,
<em>Eugenius</em>
stept in with an intent to take his last sight and last farewell of him:


<ps>
Upon his drawing

curtain, and asking how he felt himself,

looking up in his face, took hold of his hand,---and, after thanking him

<ps>for the many tokens of his friendship to him, for which, he said, if it was their fate to meet hereafter,---he would thank him again and again. </ps>

---He told him, he was within a few hours of giving his enemies the slip for ever. 

---I hope not, answered
<em>Eugenius,</em>
with tears trickling down his cheeks, and with the tenderest tone that ever man spoke,---I hope not,
<em>Yorick,</em>
said he.


---
<em>Yorick</em>
replied, with a look up, and a gentle squeeze of
<em>Eugenius's</em>
hand, and that was all,---but it cut
<em>Eugenius</em>
to his heart.


---Come,--- come,
<em>Yorick,</em>
quoth
<em>Eugenius,</em>
wiping his eyes, and summoning up the man within him,---my dear lad, be comforted, ---let not all thy spirits and fortitude forsake thee at this crisis when thou most wants them;---who knows what resources are in store, and what the power of God may yet do for thee?

laid his hand upon his heart, and gently shook his head;---for my part, continued

crying bitterly as he uttered the words,---I declare I know not,
<em>Yorick,</em>
how to part with thee,---and would gladly flatter my hopes, added

chearing up his voice, that there is still enough left of thee to make a bishop,---and that I may live to see it.

could perceive a stream of lambent fire lighted up for a moment in his eyes;---faint picture of those flashes of his spirit, which (as

<strong>It</strong>
is so long since the reader of this rhapsodical work has been parted from the midwife, that it is high time to mention her again to him, merely to put him in mind that there is such a body still in the world, and whom, upon the best judgment I can form upon my own plan at present,---I am going to introduce to him for good and all:

But as fresh matter may be started, and much unexpected business fall out betwixt the reader and myself, which may require immediate dispatch;---'twas right to take care that the poor woman should not be lost in the mean time;---because when she is wanted, we can no way do without her.

<p>

I think I told you that this good woman was a person of no small note and consequence throughout our whole village and township;---that her fame had spread itself to the very out-edge and circumference of that circle of importance, of which kind every soul living, whether he has a shirt to his back or no,---has one surrounding him;---which said circle, by the way, whenever 'tis said that such a one is of great weight and importance in the
<em>world,</em>
---I desire may be enlarged or contracted in your worship's fancy, in a compound-ratio of the station, profession, knowledge, abilities, height and depth (measuring both ways) of the personage brought before you.

</p> 
<p>


<ps>In the present case, if I remember, I fixed it at about four or five miles, which not only comprehended the whole parish, </ps>

<ps>but extended itself to two or three of the adjacent hamlets in the skirts of the next parish; which made a considerable thing of it. </ps>

I must add, That she was, moreover, very well looked on at one large grange-house and some other odd houses and farms within two or three miles, as I said, from the smoke of her own chimney: 

<ps>---But I must here, once for all, inform you, that all this will be more exactly delineated and explain'd in a map, now in the hands of the engraver, which, with many other pieces and developments to this work, will be added to the end of the twentieth volume, ---not to swell the work,---I detest the thought of such a thing;---but by way of commentary, scholium, illustration, and key to such passages, incidents, or inuendos as shall be thought to be either of private interpretation, or of dark </ps>

---"That in case my mother hereafter should, at any time, put my father to the trouble and expence of a
<em>London</em>
journey upon false cries and tokens;---that for every such instance she should forfeit all the right and title which the covenant gave her to the next turn;---but to no more,---and so on,
<em>toties quoties,</em>
in as effectual a manner, as if such a covenant betwixt them had not been made."

---This, by the way, was no more than what was reasonable;---and yet, as reasonable as it was, I have ever thought it hard that the whole weight of the article should have fallen entirely, as it did, upon myself.

<p>
But I was begot and born to misfortunes; ---for my poor mother, whether it was wind or water,---or a compound of both,---or neither;---or whether it was simply the mere swell of imagination and fancy in her;---or how far a strong wish and desire to have it so, might mislead her judgment;---in short, whether she was deceived or deceiving in this matter, it no way becomes me to decide. 

The fact was this, That, in the latter end of
<em>September,</em>
1717, which was the year before I was born, my mother having carried my father up to town much against the grain,---he peremptorily insisted upon the clause;---so that I was doom'd, by marriage articles, to have my nose squeez'd as flat to my face, as if the destinies had actually spun me without one.

thing else was the provoking time of the year,---which, as I told you, was towards the end of
<em>September,</em>
when his wall-fruit, and green gages especially, in which he was very curious, were just ready for pulling:

---"Had he been whistled up to
<em>London,</em>
upon a
<em>Tom Fool's</em>
errand in any other month of the whole year, he should not have said three words about it."

</p> 
<p>

For the next two whole stages, no subject would go down, but the heavy blow he had sustain'd from the loss of a son, whom it seems he had fully reckon'd upon in his mind, and register'd down in his pocket-book, as a second staff for his old age, in case
<em>Bobby</em>
should fail him.

</p> 
<p>

From
<em>Stilton,</em>
all the way to
<em>Grantham,</em>
nothing in the whole affair provoked him so much as the condolences of his friends, and the foolish figure they should both make at church the first
<em>Sunday</em>
; ---of which, in the satirical vehemence of his wit, now sharpen'd a little by vexation, he would give so many humorous and provoking descriptions,---and place his rib and self in so many tormenting lights and attitudes in the face of the whole congregation;---that my mother declared, these two stages were so truly tragi-comical, that she did nothing but laugh and cry in a breath, from one end to the other of them all the way.

From

till they had cross'd the

my father was out of all kind of patience at the vile trick and imposition which he fancied my mother had put upon him in this affair.


<ps>
---"Certainly, he would say to himself, over and over again, "the woman could not be deceived herself;---if she could,--- what weakness!---tormenting word! which led his imagination a thorny dance, and, before all was over, play'd the duce and all with him;"---for sure as ever the word
<em>weakness</em>
was uttered, and struck full upon his brain,--- so sure it set him upon running divisions upon how many kinds of weaknesses there were;---that there was such a thing as weakness of the body, ---as well as weakness of the mind,--- and then he would do nothing but syllogize within himself for a stage or two

</p> 
<p>
In short, he had so many little subjects of disquietude springing out of this one affair, all fretting successively in his mind as they rose up in it, that my mother, whatever was her journey up, had but an uneasy journey of it down. 

--- In a word, as she complained to my uncle
<em>Toby,</em>
he would have tired out the patience of any flesh alive.

clause in the marriage settlement empowered him; nor was it till the very night in which I was begot, which was thirteen months after, that she had the least intimation of his design;---when my father, happening, as you remember, to be a little chagrin'd and out of temper,---took occasion as they lay chatting gravely in bed afterwards, talking over what was to come,---to let her know that she must accommodate herself as well as she could to the bargain made between them in their marriage deeds; which was to lye-in of her next child in the country to balance the last year's journey.

to cast her eyes upon the midwife, whom you have so often heard me mention; and before the week was well got round, as the famous Dr.
<em>Maningham</em>
was not to be had, she had come to a final determination in her mind,---notwithstanding there was a scientifick operator within so near a call as eight miles of us, and who, moreover, had expressly wrote a five shillings book upon the subject of midwifery, in which he had exposed, not only the blunders of the sisterhood itself,---but had likewise superadded many curious improvements for the quicker extraction of the foetus in cross births, and some other cases of danger which belay us in getting into the world; notwithstanding all this, my mother, I say, was absolutely determined to trust her life and mine with it, into no soul's hand but this old woman's only.

By this means I shall take care, that my metropolis totter'd not thro' its own weight;---that the head be no longer too big for the body;--- that the extreams, now wasted and pin'd in, be restored to their due share of nourishment, and regain, with it, their natural strength and beauty: 
--- I would effectually provide, That the meadows and corn-fields, of my dominions, should laugh and sing;--- that good chear and hospitality flourish once more;---and that such weight and influence be put thereby into the hands of the Squirality of my kingdom, as should counterpoise what I perceive my Nobility are now taking from them.

"Why are there so few palaces and gentlemen's seats," he would ask, with some emotion, as he walked a-cross the room, "throughout so many delicious provinces in

?


Whence is it that the few remaining
<em>Chateaus</em>
amongst them are so dismantled,---so unfurnished, and in so ruinous and desolate a condition?


---Because, Sir, (he would say) in that kingdom no man has any country-interest to support;---the little interest of any kind, which any man has any where in it, is concentrated in the court, and the looks of the Grand Monarch; by the sun-shine of whose countenance, or the clouds which pass a-cross it, every

man lives or dies."

<ps>the least evil accident in my mother's lying-in in the country,---was, That any such instance would infallibly throw a balance of power, too great already, into the weaker vessels of the gentry, in his own, or higher stations;---which, with the many other usurped rights which that part of the constitution was hourly establishing,---would, in the end, prove fatal to the monarchical system of domestick government established in the first creation of things by God. </ps>


</p> 
<p>


<ps>
In this point he was entirely of Sir
<em>Robert Filmer's</em>
opinion, That the plans and institutions of the greatest monarchies in the eastern parts of the world, were, originally, all stolen from that admirable pattern and prototype of this houshold and paternal power;---which, for a century, he said, and more, had

For all these reasons, private and publick, put together,---my father was for having the man-midwife by all means,--- my mother by no means. 
My father begg'd and intreated, she would for once recede from her prerogative in this matter, and suffer him to choose for her;--- my mother, on the contrary, insisted upon her privilege in this matter, to choose for herself,---and have no mortal's help but the old woman's.

---It is not impossible, but that my dear, dear

<ps>I see plainly, Sir, by your looks, (or as the case happen'd) my father would say,---that you do not heartily subscribe to this opinion of mine,---which, to those, he would add, who have not carefully sifted it to the bottom,---I own has an air more of fancy than of solid reasoning in it;---and yet, my dear Sir, if I may presume to know your character, I am morally assured, I should hazard little in stating a case to you,---not as a party in the dispute,---but as a judge, and trusting my appeal upon it to your own good sense and candid disquisition in this matter; ---you are a person free from as many narrow prejudices of education as most men;---and, if I may presume to penetrate further into you,---of a liberality </ps>

Your son!---your dear son,---from whose sweet and open temper you have so much to expect. 

---Your
<strong>Billy,</strong>
Sir!---would you, for the world, have called him
<strong>Judas</strong>
?


---Would you, my dear Sir, he would say, laying his hand upon your breast, with the genteelest address,---and in that soft and irresistible
<em>piano</em>
of voice, which the nature of the
<em>argumentum ad hominem</em>
absolutely requires,---Would you, Sir, if a

of a godfather had proposed the name for your child, and offered you his purse along with it, would you have consented to such a desecration of him?

Your greatness of mind in this action, which I admire, with that generous contempt of money which you shew me in the whole transaction, is really noble;--- and what renders it more so, is the principle of it;---the workings of a parent's love upon the truth and conviction of this very hypothesis, namely, That was your son called
<strong>Judas,</strong>
---the sordid and treacherous idea, so inseparable from the name, would have accompanied him thro' life like his shadow, and, in the end, made a miser and a rascal of him, in spight, Sir, of your example.

</ps>


</p> 
<p>


<ps>To work with them in the best manner he could, was what my father was, however, perpetually forced upon;--- for he had a thousand little sceptical notions of the comick kind to defend,--- most of which notions, I verily believe, </ps>

; and as such he would make merry with them for half an hour or so, and having sharpen'd his wit upon 'em, dismiss them till another day.
</ps>


</p> 
<p>
I mention this, not only as matter of hypothesis or conjecture upon the progress and establishment of my father's many odd opinions,---but as a warning to the learned reader against the indiscreet reception of such guests, who, after a free and undisturbed enterance, for some years, into our brains,---at length claim a kind of settlement there,---working sometimes like yeast;---but more generally after the manner of the gentle passion, beginning in jest,---but ending in downright earnest.

<p>
Whether this was the case of the singularity of my father's notions,---or that his judgment, at length, became the dupe of his wit;---or how far, in many of his notions, he might, tho' odd, be absolutely right;---the reader, as he comes at them, shall decide. 
All that I maintain here, is, that in this one, of the influence of Christian names, however it gain'd footing, he was serious;--- he was all uniformity;---he was systematical, and, like all systematick reasoners, he would move both heaven and earth, and twist and torture every thing in nature to support his hypothesis. 

<ps>In a word, I repeat it over again;---he was serious;---and, in consequence of it, he would lose all kind of patience whenever he saw people, especially of condition, who should have known better,---as careless and as indifferent about the name </ps>

<p>

This, he would say, look'd ill;---and had, moreover, this particular aggravation in it,
<em>viz.</em>
That when once a vile name was wrongfully or injudiciously given, 'twas not like the case of a man's character, which, when wrong'd, might hereafter be clear'd;---and, possibly, sometime or other, if not in the man's life, at least after his death,---be, somehow or other, set to rights with the world:

But the injury of this, he would say, could never be undone;---nay, he doubted even whether an act of parliament could reach it: 

<ps>---He knew as well as you, that the legislature assum'd a power over surnames;---but for very strong reasons, which he could give, it had never </ps>

<br>

<ps>yet adventured, he would say, to go a step further. </ps>


</p> 
<p>
It was observable, that tho' my father, in consequence of this opinion, had, as I have told you, the strongest likings and dislikings towards certain names;---that there were still numbers of names which hung so equally in the balance before him, that they were absolutely indifferent to him. 

<em>Jack, Dick,</em>
and
<em>Tom</em>
were of this class:


<ps>These my father call'd neutral names;---affirming of them, without a satyr, That there had been as many knaves and fools, at least, as wise and good men, since the world began, who had indifferently borne them;---so that, like equal forces acting against each other in contrary directions, he thought they mutually destroyed each others effects; for which reason, he would often declare, </ps>

<a href="/displayFigure.do?id=tsv1p132.tif"><img style="border:1px solid #000" alt="View Figure" src="/thumbnails/tn_tsv1p132.gif"></a>
<br>

<ps>He would not give a cherry-stone to choose amongst them. </ps>



<em>Bob,</em>
which was my brother's name, was another of these neutral kinds of Christian names, which operated very little either way; and as my father happen'd to be at
<em>Epsom,</em>
when it was given him,---he would oft times thank heaven it was no worse.


<em>Andrew</em>
was something like a negative quantity in Algebra with him;---'twas worse, he said, than nothing.


---
<em>William</em>
stood pretty high:


---
<em>Numps</em>
again was low with him;---and
<em>Nick,</em>
he said, was the
<strong>Devil</strong>
.

</p> 
<p>

But, of all the names in the universe, he had the most unconquerable aversion for
<strong><a href='#Hit31' class='hitmarker' title='View previous hit'><i class="icon-caret-left"></i></a><a name='Hit32'></a><span class="hit">Tristram</span><a href='#Hit33' class='hitmarker' title='View next hit'><i class="icon-caret-right"></i></a></strong>
;---he had the lowest and most contemptible opinion of it of any thing in the world,---thinking it could possibly produce nothing in

but what was extreamly mean and pitiful:

<a href="/displayFigure.do?id=tsv1p133.tif"><img style="border:1px solid #000" alt="View Figure" src="/thumbnails/tn_tsv1p133.gif"></a>
<br>

So that in the midst of a dispute on the subject, in which, by the bye, he was frequently involved,---he would sometimes break off in a sudden and spirited
<strong>Epiphonema,</strong>
or rather
<strong>Erotesis,</strong>
raised a third, and sometimes a full fifth, above the key of the discourse,---and demand it categorically of his antagonist, Whether he would take upon him to say, he had ever remember'd,---whether he had ever read,---or even whether he had ever heard tell of a man, call'd
<em><a href='#Hit32' class='hitmarker' title='View previous hit'><i class="icon-caret-left"></i></a><a name='Hit33'></a><span class="hit">Tristram</span><a href='#Hit34' class='hitmarker' title='View next hit'><i class="icon-caret-right"></i></a>,</em>

---The thing is impossible.

What could be wanting in my father but to have wrote a book to publish this notion of his to the world?

<p>
---How could you, Madam, be so inattentive in reading the last chapter? 

I told you in it,
<em>That my mother was not a papist</em>
.

--- Papist! You told me no such thing, Sir. 
Madam, I beg leave to repeat it over again, That I told you as plain, at least, as words, by direct inference, could tell you such a thing. 
---Then, Sir, I must have miss'd a page. 
---No, Madam, ---you have not miss'd a word. 
--- Then I was asleep, Sir. 
---My pride, Madam, cannot allow you that refuge. 
--- Then, I declare, I know nothing at all about the matter. 
---That, Madam, is the very fault I lay to your charge; and as a punishment for it, I do insist upon it, that you immediately turn back, that is, as soon as you get to the next full stop, and read the whole chapter over again.

I have imposed this penance upon the lady, neither out of wantonness or cruelty, but from the best of motives; and therefore shall make her no apology for it when she returns back: 
---'Tis to rebuke a vicious taste which has crept into thousands besides herself,---of reading straight forwards, more in quest of the adventures, than of the deep erudition and knowledge which a book of this cast, if read over as it should be, would infallibly impart with them. 

---The mind should be accustomed to make wise reflections, and draw curious conclusions as it goes along; the habitude of which made
<em>Pliny</em>
the younger affirm, "That he never read a book so bad, but he drew some profit from it."

The stories of

---But here comes my fair Lady. 
Have you read over again the chapter, Madam, as I desired you? 
---You have: 
And did you not observe the passage, upon the second reading, which admits the inference? 
---Not a word like it! 

Then, Madam, be pleased to ponder well the last line but one of the chapter, where I take upon me to say, "It was
<em>necessary</em>
I should be born before I was christen'd."


Had my mother, Madam, been a Papist, that consequence did not follow.

<strong><em>Le</em></strong>
Conseil estime, que la question propos&eacute;e souffre de grandes difficultes.


Les Th&eacute;ologiens posent d'un cot&eacute; pour principe, que le bapt&eacute;me, qui est une naissance spirituelle, suppose une premiere naissance; il faut &ecirc;tre n&eacute; dans le monde, pour ren&acirc;itre en
Jesus Christ,
comme ils l'enseignent.


S.
Thomas, 3 part. qu&aelig;st. 88. artic. 11
. suit cette doctrine comme une verit&eacute; constante; l'on ne peut, dit ce S. Docteur, baptiser les enfans qui sont renferm&eacute;s dans le sein de leurs Meres, et S.
Thomas
est fond&eacute; sur ce, que les enfans ne sont point n&eacute;s, &amp; ne peuvent &ecirc;tre compt&eacute;s parmi les autres hommes; d'ou il conclud, qu'ils ne peuvent &ecirc;tre l'object d'une action ext&eacute;rieure, pour recevoir par leur minist&eacute;re, les sacremens n&eacute;cessaires au salut:

in lucem ut cum aliis hominibus vitam ducant; unde non possunt subjici actioni human&aelig;, ut per eorum ministerium sacramenta recipiant ad salutem.

Les rituels ordonnent dans la pratique ce que les th&eacute;ologiens ont &eacute;tabli sur les m&ecirc;mes mati&eacute;res, &amp; ils deffendent tous d'une mani&eacute;re uniforme de baptiser les enfans qui sont renferm&eacute;s dans le sein de leurs meres, s'ils ne font paroitre quelque partie de leurs corps. 

<ps>Le concours des th&eacute;ologiens, &amp; des rituels, qui sont les r&eacute;gles des dioc&eacute;ses, par&ocirc;it former une autorit&eacute; qui termine la question presente; cependant le conseil de conscience considerant d'un cot&eacute;, que le raisonnement des th&eacute;ologiens est uniquement fond&eacute; sur une raison de convenance, &amp; que la deffense des rituels, suppose que l'on ne peut baptiser immediatement les enfans ainsi renferm&eacute;s dans le sein de leurs meres, ce qui est contre la supposition presente; &amp; d'un autre c&ocirc;t&eacute;, considerant que les m&ecirc;mes </ps>

On conseile au moins &agrave; celui qui consulte, de s'addresser &agrave; son ev&ecirc;que, &amp; de lui faire part de la presente d&eacute;cision, afin que, si le prelat entre dans les raisons sur lesquelles les docteurs soussign&eacute;s s'appuyent, il puisse &ecirc;tre autoris&eacute; dans le cas de n&eacute;cessit&eacute;, ou il risqueroit trop d' attendre que la permission f&ucirc;t demand&eacute;e &amp; accord&eacute;e d'employer le moyen qu' il propose si avantageux au salut de l'enfant.

</p> 
<p>

I think, replied my uncle
<em>Toby,</em>
taking his pipe from his mouth, and striking the head of it two or three times upon the nail of his left thumb, as he began his sentence,---I think, says he:


--- But to enter rightly into my uncle
<em>Toby's</em>
sentiments upon this matter, you must be made to enter first a little into his character, the out-lines of which I shall just give you, and then the dialogue between him and my father will go on as well again.

---Pray what was that man's name,--- for I write in such a hurry, I have no time to recollect or look for it,---who first made the observation, "That there was great inconstancy in our air and climate?" 
Whoever he was, 'twas a just and good observation in him. 
---But the corollary drawn from it, namely, "That it is this which has furnished us with such a variety of odd and whimsical characters;" ---that was not his;---it was found out by another man, at least a century and a half after him: 

<ps>
---Then again,---that this copious store-house of original materials, is the true and natural cause that our Comedies are so much better than those of
<em>France,</em>
or any others that either have, or can be wrote upon the Continent;---that discovery was not fully made till about the middle of king

Indeed towards the latter end of queen
<em>Anne,</em>
the great

began to patronize the notion, and more fully explained it to the world in one or two of his Spectators;---but the discovery was not his.


---Then, fourthly and lastly, that this strange irregularity in our climate, producing so strange an irregularity in our characters,---doth thereby, in some sort, make us amends, by giving us somewhat to make us merry with when the weather will not suffer us to go out of doors,---that observation is my own;--- and was struck out by me this very rainy day,

whom all this while we have left knocking the ashes out of his tobacco pipe.

<ps>and I should have made no scruple of ranking him amongst one of the first-rate productions of it, had not there appear'd too many strong lines in it of a family-likeness, which shewed that he derived the singularity of his temper more from blood, than either wind or water, or any modifications or combinations of them whatever: </ps>



<ps>
And I have, therefore, oft times wondered, that my father, tho' I believe he had his reasons for it, upon his observing some tokens of excentricity in my course when I was a boy,---should never once endeavour to account for them in this way; for all the

<p>

It will seem very strange,---and I would as soon think of dropping a riddle in the reader's way, which is not my interest to do, as set him upon guessing how it could come to pass, that an event of this kind, so many years after it had happened, should be reserved for the interruption of the peace and unity, which otherwise so cordially subsisted, between my father and my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
.

One would have thought, that the whole force of the misfortune should have spent and wasted itself in the family at first,---as is generally the case: 
---But nothing ever wrought with our family after the ordinary way.

---Observe, I determine nothing upon this.

---or in the decisive Manner of

who outwits himself and his reader;---but with the officious humility of a heart devoted to the assistance merely of the inquisitive;--- to them I write,---and by them I shall be read,---if any such reading as this could be supposed to hold out so long, to the very end of the world.

Why this cause of sorrow, therefore, was thus reserved for my father and uncle, is undetermined by me. 
But how and in what direction it exerted itself, so as to become the cause of dissatisfaction between them, after it began to operate, is what I am able to explain with great exactness, and is as follows: 
</p> 
<p>


<ps>
My uncle
<strong>Toby <a href='#Hit40' class='hitmarker' title='View previous hit'><i class="icon-caret-left"></i></a><a name='Hit41'></a><span class="hit">Shandy</span><a href='#Hit42' class='hitmarker' title='View next hit'><i class="icon-caret-right"></i></a>,</strong>
Madam, was a gentleman, who, with the virtues which usually constitute the character of a man of honour and rectitude,---possessed one in a very eminent degree, which is seldom or never put into the catalogue; and that was a most extream and unparallel'd modesty of nature;---tho' I correct the word nature, for this reason, that I may not prejudge a point which must shortly come to a hearing; and that is, Whether this modesty of his was natural

<br>

<ps>or acquir'd. </ps>


---Which ever way my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
came by it, 'twas nevertheless modesty in the truest sense of it; and that is, Madam, not in regard to words, for he was so unhappy as to have very little choice in them,---but to things;---and this kind of modesty so possess'd him, and it arose to such a height in him, as almost to equal, if such a thing could be, even the modesty of a woman:

That female nicety, Madam, and inward cleanliness of mind and fancy, in your sex, which makes you so much the awe of ours. 
</p> 
<p>


<ps>
You will imagine, Madam, that my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
had contracted all this from this very source;---that he had spent a great part of his time in converse with your sex; and that, from a thorough knowledge of you, and the force of imitation

<br>

<ps>which such fair examples render irresistable, ---he had acquired this amiable turn of mind. </ps>


</p> 
<p>

I wish I could say so,---for unless it was with his sister-in-law, my father's wife and my mother,---my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
scarce exchanged three words with the sex in as many years;---no, he got it, Madam, by a blow.

---A blow! 

---Yes, Madam, it was owing to a blow from a stone, broke off by a ball from the parapet of a horn-work at the siege of
<em>Namur,</em>
which struck full upon my uncle
<em>Toby's</em>
groin.

---Which way could that effect it? 
The story of that, Madam, is long and interesting;---but it would be running my history all upon heaps to give it you here. 

<ps>---'Tis for an episode hereafter; and every circumstance relating to it in its proper place, shall be faithfully laid </ps>

<ps>before you: </ps>


---'Till then, it is not in my power to give further light into this matter, or say more than what I have said already,---That my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
was a gentleman of unparallel'd modesty, which happening to be somewhat subtilized and rarified by the constant heat of a little family-pride,---they both so wrought together within him, that he could never bear to hear the affair of my aunt
<strong>Dinah</strong>
touch'd upon, but with the greatest emotion.


<ps>
---The least hint of it was enough to make the blood fly into his face;---but when my father enlarged upon the story in mixed companies, which the illustration of his hypothesis frequently obliged him to do,---the unfortunate blight of one of the fairest branches of the family, would set my uncle
<em>Toby's</em>
honour and modesty o'bleeding; and he would often take my father

<br>

<ps>aside, in the greatest concern imaginable, to expostulate and tell him, he would give him any thing in the world, only to let the story rest. </ps>


</p> 
<p>

My father, I believe, had the truest love and tenderness for my uncle
<em>Toby,</em>
that ever one brother bore towards another, and would have done any thing in nature, which one brother in reason could have desir'd of another, to have made my uncle
<em>Toby's</em>
heart easy in this, or any other point.

But this lay out of his power. 
</p> 
<p>

---My father, as I told you, was a philosopher in grain,---speculative,--- systematical;---and my aunt
<em>Dinah's</em>
affair was a matter of as much consequence to him, as the retrogradation of the planets to
<em>Copernicus</em>
:

<ps>
system, call'd so after his name; and the backslidings of my aunt
<em>Dinah</em>
in her orbit, did the same service in establishing my father's system, which, I trust, will for ever hereafter be call'd the
<em>Shandean System,</em>
after his.
</ps>


</p> 
<p>

In any other family dishonour, my father, I believe, had as nice a sense of shame as any man whatever;---and neither he, nor, I dare say,
<em>Copernicus,</em>
would have divulged the affair in either case, or have taken the least notice of it to the world, but for the obligations they owed, as they thought, to truth.


---
<em>Amicus Plato,</em>
my father would say, construing the words to my uncle
<em>Toby,</em>
as he went along,
<em>Amicus Plato</em>
; that is,
<strong>Dinah</strong>
was my aunt;---
<em>sed magis amica veritas</em>
---but
<strong>Truth</strong>
is my sister.

<p>
This contrariety of humours betwixt my father and my uncle, was the source of many a fraternal squabble. 
The one could not bear to hear the tale of family disgrace recorded,---and the other would scarce ever let a day pass to an end without some hint at it. 
</p> 
<p>

For God's sake, my uncle

would cry,---and for my sake, and for all our sakes, my dear brother

---do let this story of our aunt's and her ashes sleep in peace;---how can you,--- how can you have so little feeling and compassion for the character of our family:

---What is the character of a family to an hypothesis? my father would reply. 
---Nay, if you come to that--- what is the life of a family:

<ps>and lifting up his hands, his eyes, and one leg. </ps>

---Yes the life,---my father would say, maintaining his point. 
How many thousands of 'em are there every year that comes cast away, (in all civilized countries at least)---and consider'd as nothing but common air, in competition of an hypothesis. 

In my plain sense of things, my uncle
<em>Toby,</em>
would answer,---every such instance is downright
<strong>Murder,</strong>
let who will commit it.


---There lies your mistake, my father would reply;---for, in
<em>Foro Scienti&aelig;</em>
there is no such thing as
<strong>Murder,</strong>
---'tis only
<strong>Death,</strong>
brother.

</p> 
<p>

My uncle

would never offer to answer this by any other kind of argument, than that of whistling half a dozen bars of
<em>Lillabullero</em>

As not one of our logical writers, nor any of the commentators upon them, that I remember, have thought proper to give a name to this particular species of argument,---I here take the liberty to do it myself, for two reasons. 

First, That, in order to prevent all confusion in disputes, it may stand as much distinguished for ever, from every other species of argument,---as the

And if the end of disputation is more to silence than convince,---they may add, if they please, to one of the best arguments too.

I do therefore, by these presents, strictly order and command, That it be known and distinguished by the name and title of the

and the

As for the
<em>Argumentum Tripodium,</em>
which is never used but by the woman against the man;---and the
<em>Argumentum ad Rem,</em>
which, contrarywise, is made use of by the man only against the woman:

---As these two are enough in conscience for one lecture;---and, moreover, as the one is the best answer to the other,---let them likewise be kept apart, and be treated of in a place by themselves.

<strong>The</strong>
learned Bishop
<em>Hall,</em>
I mean the famous Dr.
<em>Joseph Hall,</em>
who was Bishop of
<em>Exeter</em>
in King
<em>James</em>
the First's reign, tells us in one of his
<em>Decads,</em>
at the end of his divine art of meditation, imprinted at

in the year 1610, by

<ps>"That it is an abominable thing for a man to commend himself;"---and I really think it is so. </ps>


</p> 
<p>
And yet, on the other hand, when a thing is executed in a masterly kind of a fashion, which thing is not likely to be found out;---I think it is full as abominable, that a man should lose the honour of it, and go out of the world with the conceit of it rotting in his head. 
</p> 
<p>
This is precisely my situation. 
</p> 
<p>


<ps>For in this long digression which I was accidentally led into, as in all my digressions (one only excepted) there is a master-stroke of digressive skill, the merit of which has all along, I fear, been overlooked by my reader,---not for want of penetration in him,---but because 'tis </ps>

<br>

<ps>an excellence seldom looked for, or expected indeed, in a digression;---and it is this: </ps>


That tho' my digressions are all fair, as you observe,---and that I fly off from what I am about, as far and as often too as any writer in
<em>Great-Britain</em>
; yet I constantly take care to order affairs so, that my main business does not stand still in my absence.

</p> 
<p>

I was just going, for example, to have given you the great out-lines of my uncle
<em>Toby's</em>
most whimsical character;---when my aunt
<em>Dinah</em>
and the coachman came a-cross us, and led us a vagary some millions of miles into the very heart of the planetary system:


<ps>
Notwithstanding all this you perceive that the drawing of my uncle
<em>Toby's</em>
character went on gently all the time;---not the great contours of it,---that was impossible,---but some familiar

<ps>
strokes and faint designations of it, were here and there touch'd in, as we went along, so that you are much better acquainted with my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
now than you was before.
</ps>


</p> 
<p>
By this contrivance the machinery of my work is of a species by itself; two contrary motions are introduced into it, and reconciled, which were thought to be at variance with each other. 
In a word, my work is digressive, and it is progressive too,---and at the same time. 
</p> 
<p>


<ps>This, Sir, is a very different story from that of the earth's moving round her axis, in her diurnal rotation, with her progress in her elliptick orbit which brings about the year, and constitutes that variety and vicissitude of seasons we enjoy;---though I own it suggested the </ps>

<br>

<ps>thought,---as I believe the greatest of our boasted improvements and discoveries have come from some such trifling hints. </ps>


</p> 
<p>
Digressions, incontestably, are the sunshine; ---they are the life, the soul of reading;---take them out of this book for instance,---you might as well take the book along with them;---one cold eternal winter would reign in every page of it; restore them to the writer;---he steps forth like a bridegroom,---bids All hail; brings in variety, and forbids the appetite to fail. 
</p> 
<p>
All the dexterity is in the good cookery and management of them, so as to be not only for the advantage of the reader, but also of the author, whose distress, in this matter, is truely pitiable:

For, if he begins a digression,---from that moment, I observe, his whole work stands stock-still;---and if he goes on with his main work,---then there is an end of his digression. 
</p> 
<p>
---This is vile work. 
---For which reason, from the beginning of this, you see, I have constructed the main work and the adventitious parts of it with such intersections, and have so complicated and involved the digressive and progessive movements, one wheel within another, that the whole machine, in general, has been kept a-going;---and, what's more, it shall be kept a-going these forty years, if it pleases the fountain of health to bless me so long with life and good spirits.

But this, as I said above, is not the case of the inhabitants of this earth;--- our minds shine not through the body, but are wrapt up here in a dark covering of uncrystalized flesh and blood; so that if we would come to the specifick characters of them, we must go some other way to work. 
</p> 
<p>
Many, in good truth, are the ways which human wit has been forced to take to do this thing with exactness. 
</p> 
<p>
Some, for instance, draw all their characters with wind instruments.

I am not ignorant that the

pretend to a mathematical exactness in their designations of one particular sort of character among them, from the

or

of a certain wind instrument they use,---which they say is infallible.


---I dare not mention the name of the instrument in this place;---'tis sufficient we have it amongst us,---but never think of making a drawing by it;---this is &aelig;nigmatical, and intended to be so, at least,
<em>ad populum</em>
:

--- And therefore I beg, Madam, when you come here, that you read on as fast as you can, and never stop to make any inquiry about it. 
</p> 
<p>


<ps>There are others again, who will draw a man's character from no other helps in the world, but merely from his evacuations; ---but this often gives a very incorrect </ps>

<strong>If</strong>
I was not morally sure that the reader must be out of all patience for my uncle
<em>Toby's</em>
character,---I would here previously have convinced him, that there is no instrument so fit to draw such a thing with, as that which I have pitch'd upon.

<p>

A man and his
<strong>Hobby-Horse,</strong>
tho' I cannot say that they act and re-act exactly after the same manner in which the soul and body do upon each other:


Yet doubtless there is a communication between them of some kind, and my opinion rather is, that there is something in it more of the manner of electrified bodies,---and that by means of the heated parts of the rider, which come immediately into contact with the back of the
<strong>Hobby-Horse</strong>
.


---By long journies and much friction, it so happens that the body of the rider is at length fill'd as full of
<strong>Hobby-Horsical</strong>
matter as it can hold;---so that if you are able to give but a clear description of the nature of the one, you may form a pretty exact notion of the genius and character of the other.

</p>

<br>

<p>

Now the
<strong>Hobby-Horse</strong>
which my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
always rode upon, was, in my opinion, an
<strong>Hobby-Horse</strong>
well worth giving a description of, if it was only upon the score of his great singularity; for you might have travelled from
<em>York</em>
to
<em>Dover,</em>
---from
<em>Dover</em>
to
<em>Penzance</em>
in
<em>Cornwall,</em>
and from
<em>Penzance</em>
to
<em>York</em>
back again, and not have seen such another upon the road; or if you had seen such a one, whatever haste you had been in, you must infallibly have stopp'd to have taken a view of him.


Indeed, the gait and figure of him was so strange, and so utterly unlike was he, from his head to his tail, to any one of the whole species, that it was now and then made a matter of dispute,---whether he was really a
<strong>Hobby-Horse</strong>
or no:

<ps>
the reality of motion, save that of rising up upon his legs, and walking a-cross the room;---so would my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
use no other argument to prove his
<strong>Hobby-Horse</strong>
was a
<strong>Hobby-Horse</strong>
indeed, but by getting upon his back and riding him about;---leaving the world after that to determine the point as it thought fit.
</ps>


</p> 
<p>

In good truth, my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
mounted him with so much pleasure, and he carried my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
so well,---that he troubled his head very little with what the world either said or thought about it.

</p> 
<p>
It is now high time, however, that I give you a description of him: 

---But to go on regularly, I only beg you will give me leave to acquaint you first, how my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
came by him.

<strong>The</strong>
wound in my uncle
<em>Toby's</em>
groin, which he received at the siege of
<em>Namur,</em>
rendering him unfit for the service, it was thought expedient he should return to
<em>England,</em>
in order, if possible, to be set to rights.

</p> 
<p>


<ps>
He was four years totally confined,--- part of it to his bed, and all of it to his room; and in the course of his cure, which was all that time in hand, suffer'd unspeakable miseries,---owing to a succession of exfoliations from the
<em>oss pubis,</em>
and the outward edge of that part of the
<em>coxendix</em>
called the
<em>oss illeum,</em>
---both which bones were dismally crush'd, as much by the irregularity of the stone, which I told you was broke off the parapet,

<ps>
---as by its size,---(though it was pretty large) which inclined the surgeon all along to think, that the great injury which it had done my uncle
<em>Toby's</em>
groin, was more owing to the gravity of the stone itself, than to the projectile force of it,---which he would often tell him was a great happiness.
</ps>


</p> 
<p>

My father at that time was just beginning business in
<em>London,</em>
and had taken a house;---and as the truest friendship and cordiality subsisted between the two brothers, ---and that my father thought my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
could no where be so well nursed and taken care of as in his own house,---he assign'd him the very best apartment in it.


<ps>---And what was a much more sincere mark of his affection still, he would never suffer a friend or an acquaintance to step into the house on any </ps>

occasion, but he would take him by the hand, and lead him up stairs to see his brother
<em>Toby,</em>
and chat an hour by his bed side.
</ps>


</p> 
<p>
The history of a soldier's wound beguiles the pain of it;---my uncle's visiters at least thought so, and in their daily calls upon him, from the courtesy arising out of that belief, they would frequently turn the discourse to that subject,---and from that subject the discourse would generally roll on to the siege itself. 
</p> 
<p>


<ps>
These conversations were infinitely kind; and my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
received great relief from them, and would have received much more, but that they brought him into some unforeseen perplexities, which, for three months together, retarded his cure greatly; and if he had

</p> 
<p>

What these perplexities of my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
were,---'tis impossible for you to guess;---if you could,---I should blush; not as a relation,---not as a man,---nor even as a woman,---but I should blush as an author; inasmuch as I set no small store by myself upon this very account, that my reader has never yet been able to guess at any thing.

And in this, Sir, I am of so nice and singular a humour, that if I thought you was able to form the least judgment or probable conjecture to yourself, of what was to come in the next page,---I would tear it out of my book.

<p>


<strong>I</strong>
Have begun a new book, on purpose that I might have room enough to explain the nature of the perplexities in which my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
was involved, from the many discourses and interrogations about the siege of
<em>Namur,</em>
where he received his wound.

</p> 
<p>


<ps>
I must remind the reader, in case he has read the history of King
<em>William's</em>

<ps>
wars,---but if he has not,---I then inform him, that one of the most memorable attacks in that siege, was that which was made by the
<em>English</em>
and
<em>Dutch</em>
upon the point of the advanced counterscarp, before the gate of
<em>St. Nicolas,</em>
which inclosed the great sluice or water-stop, where the
<em>English</em>
were terribly exposed to the shot of the counter-guard and demi-bastion of
<em>St. Roch</em>
:
</ps>


The issue of which hot dispute, in three words, was this; That the
<em>Dutch</em>
lodged themselves upon the counter-guard,---and that the
<em>English</em>
made themselves masters of the covered way before
<em>St. Nicolas's</em>
gate, notwithstanding the gallantry of the
<em>French</em>
officers, who exposed themselves upon the glacis sword in hand.

</p> 
<p>


<ps>
As this was the principal attack of which my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
was an eye-witness

<ps>
at
<em>Namur,</em>
---the army of the besiegers being cut off, by the confluence of the
<em>Maes</em>
and
<em>Sambre,</em>
from seeing much of each other's operations,---my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
was generally more eloquent and particular in his account of it; and the many perplexities he was in, arose out of the almost insurmountable difficulties he found in telling his story intelligibly, and giving such clear ideas of the differences and distinctions between the scarp and counterscarp,---the glacis and covered way,---the half-moon and ravelin, ---as to make his company fully comprehend where and what he was about.
</ps>


</p> 
<p>


<ps>Writers themselves are too apt to confound these terms;---so that you will the less wonder, if in his endeavours to explain them, and in opposition to many </ps>

<br>

<ps>
misconceptions, that my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
did oft times puzzle his visiters, and sometimes himself too.
</ps>


</p> 
<p>

To speak the truth, unless the company my father led up stairs were tolerably clear-headed, or my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
was in one of his best explanatory moods, 'twas a difficult thing, do what he could, to keep the discourse free from obscurity.

</p> 
<p>


<ps>
What rendered the account of this affair the more intricate to my uncle
<em>Toby,</em>
was this,---that in the attack of the counterscarp before the gate of
<em>St. Nicolas,</em>
extending itself from the bank of the
<em>Maes,</em>
quite up to the great water-stop; ---the ground was cut and cross-cut with such a multitude of dykes, drains, rivulets, and sluices, on all sides,---and he would get so sadly bewilder'd and set

<br>

<ps>fast amongst them, that frequently he could neither get backwards or forwards to save his life; and was oft times obliged to give up the attack upon that very account only. </ps>


</p> 
<p>

These perplexing rebuffs gave my uncle
<em>Toby <a href='#Hit46' class='hitmarker' title='View previous hit'><i class="icon-caret-left"></i></a><a name='Hit47'></a><span class="hit">Shandy</span><a href='#Hit48' class='hitmarker' title='View next hit'><i class="icon-caret-right"></i></a></em>
more perturbations than you would imagine; and as my father's kindness to him was continually dragging up fresh friends and fresh inquirers, ---he had but a very uneasy task of it.

</p> 
<p>


<ps>
No doubt my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
had great command of himself,---and could guard appearances, I believe, as well as most men;---yet any one may imagine, that when he could not retreat out of the ravelin without getting into the half-moon, or get out of the covered way without

<br>

<ps>falling down the counterscarp, nor cross the dyke without danger of slipping into the ditch, but that he must have fretted and fumed inwardly: </ps>


---He did so---and these little and hourly vexations, which may seem trifling and of no account to the man who has not read
<em>Hippocrates,</em>
yet, whoever has read
<em>Hippocrates,</em>
or Dr.
<em>James Mackenzie,</em>
and has considered well the effects which the passions and affections of the mind have upon the digestion, ---(Why not of a wound as well as of a dinner?)---may easily conceive what sharp paroxisms and exacerbations of his wound my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
must have undergone upon that score only.

</p> 
<p>


<ps>
---My uncle
<em>Toby</em>
could not philosophize upon it;---'twas enough he felt it was so,---and having sustained the pain and sorrows of it for three months together,

<br>

<ps>he was resolved some way or other to extricate himself. </ps>


</p> 
<p>

He was one morning lying upon his back in his bed, the anguish and nature of the wound upon his groin suffering him to lye in no other position, when a thought came into his head, that if he could purchase such a thing, and have it pasted down upon a board, as a large map of the fortifications of the town and citadel of
<em>Namur,</em>
with its environs, it might be a means of giving him ease.


<ps>
--- I take notice of his desire to have the environs along with the town and citadel, for this reason,---because my uncle
<em>Toby's</em>
wound was got in one of the traverses, about thirty toises from the returning angle of the trench, opposite to the salient angle of the demi-bastion of
<em>St. Roch</em>
;---so that he was pretty confident

<ps>he could stick a pin upon the identical spot of ground where he was standing in when the stone struck him. </ps>

All this succeeded to his wishes, and not only freed him from a world of sad explanations, but, in the end, it prov'd the happy means, as you will read, of procuring my uncle

<strong>There</strong>
is nothing so foolish, when you are at the expence of making an entertainment of this kind, as to order things so badly, as to let your criticks and gentry of refined taste run it down:

<ps>to make them do it, as that of leaving them out of the party, or, what is full as offensive, of bestowing your attention upon the rest of your guests in so particular a way, as if there was no such thing as a critick (by occupation) at table. </ps>


</p> 
<p>
---I guard against both; for, in the first place, I have left half a dozen places purposely open for them;---and, in the next place, I pay them all court,--- Gentlemen, I kiss your hands,---I protest no company could give me half the pleasure,---by my soul I am glad to see you,---I beg only you will make no strangers of yourselves, but sit down without any ceremony, and fall on heartily.

<p>
I said I had left six places, and I was upon the point of carrying my complaisaince so far, as to have left a seventh open for them,---and in this very spot I stand on;---but being told by a critick, (tho' not by occupation,---but by nature) that I had acquitted myself well enough, I shall fill it up directly, hoping, in the mean time, that I shall be able to make a great deal of more room next year. 
</p> 
<p>

---How, in the name of wonder! could your uncle
<em>Toby,</em>
who, it seems, was a military man, and whom you have represented as no fool,---be at the same time such a confused, pudding-headed, muddle-headed fellow, as---Go look.

</p> 
<p>
So, Sir Critick, I could have replied; but I scorn it. 

<ps>---'Tis language unurbane, ---and only befitting the man </ps>

It is moreover the reply valiant,---and therefore I reject it; for tho' it might have suited my uncle
<em>Toby's</em>
character as a soldier excellently well,---and had he not accustomed himself, in such attacks, to whistle the
<em>Lillabullero,</em>
---as he wanted no courage, 'tis the very answer he would have given; yet it would by no means have done for me.

You see as plain as can be, that I write as a man of erudition;---that even my similies, my allusions, my illustrations, my metaphors, are erudite,---and that I must sustain my character properly, and contrast it properly too,---else what would become of me? 

<ps>Why, Sir, I should be undone;---at this very moment that I am going here to-fill up one </ps>

</p> 
<p>
---Therefore I answer thus: 
</p> 
<p>

Pray, Sir, in all the reading which you have ever read, did you ever read such a book as
<em>Locke's</em>
Essay upon the Human Understanding?

---Don't answer me rashly,---because many, I know, quote the book, who have not read it,---and many have read it who understand it not: 
---If either of these is your case, as I write to instruct, I will tell you in three words what the book is. 
---It is a history. 
---A history! of who? what? where? when? 
Don't hurry yourself. 

<ps>---It is a history-book, Sir, (which may possibly recommend it to the world) of what passes in a man's own mind; and if you will say so much of the book, and no more, believe </ps>

<ps>me, you will cut no contemptible figure in a metaphysic circle. </ps>


</p> 
<p>
But this by the way. 
</p> 
<p>
Now if you will venture to go along with me, and look down into the bottom of this matter, it will be found that the cause of obscurity and confusion, in the mind of man, is threefold. 
</p> 
<p>
Dull organs, dear Sir, in the first place. 
Secondly, slight and transient impressions made by objects when the said organs are not dull. 
And, thirdly, a memory like unto a sieve, not able to retain what it has received. 

---Call down
<em>Dolly</em>
your chamber-maid, and I will give you my cap and bell along with it, if I make not this matter so plain that
<em>Dolly</em>
herself shall understand it as well as
<em>Malbranch</em>
.

<br>

<ps>
When
<em>Dolly</em>
has indited her epistle to
<em>Robin,</em>
and has thrust her arm into the bottom of her pocket hanging by her right-side;---take that opportunity to recollect that the organs and faculties of perception, can, by nothing in this world, be so aptly typified and explained as by that one thing which
<em>Dolly's</em>
hand is in search of.
</ps>

---Your organs are not so dull that I should inform you,---'tis an inch, Sir, of red seal-wax. 
</p> 
<p>

When this is melted and dropp'd upon the letter, if
<em>Dolly</em>
fumbles too long for her thimble, till the wax is over harden'd, it will not receive the mark of her thimble from the usual impulse which was wont to imprint it.

Very well: 

<ps>
If
<em>Dolly's</em>
wax, for want of better, is bees-wax, or of a temper too soft,---tho' it may receive, ---it will not hold the impression,

<ps>
how hard soever
<em>Dolly</em>
thrusts against it; and last of all, supposing the wax good, and eke the thimble, but applied thereto in careless haste, as her Mistress rings the bell;---in any one of these three cases, the print, left by the thimble, will be as unlike the prototype as a brass-jack.
</ps>


</p> 
<p>

Now you must understand that not one of these was the true cause of the confusion in my uncle
<em>Toby's</em>
discourse; and it is for that very reason I enlarge upon them so long, after the manner of great physiologists,---to shew the world what it did
<em>not</em>
arise from.

</p> 
<p>


<ps>What it did arise from, I have hinted above, and a fertile source of obscurity it is,---and ever will be,---and that is the unsteady uses of words which have perplexed </ps>

It is ten to one (at

<ps>to him than his recovery, and his recovery depending, as you have read, upon the passions and affections of his mind, it behoved him to take the nicest care to make himself so far master of his subject, as to be able to talk upon it without emotion. </ps>


</p> 
<p>


<ps>
In a fortnight's close and painful application, which, by the bye, did my uncle
<em>Toby's</em>
wound, upon his groin, no good,---he was enabled, by the help of some marginal documents at the feet of the elephant, together with
<em>Gobesius's</em>
military architecture and pyroballogy, translated from the

to form his discourse with passable perspicuity; and before he was two full months gone,--- he was right eloquent upon it, and could make not only the attack of the advanced

was able to cross the

and give his visiters as distinct a history of each of their attacks, as of that of the gate of

where he had the honour to receive his wound.

But the desire of knowledge, like the thirst of riches, increases ever with the acquisition of it.

The more my uncle

The more my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
drank of this sweet fountain of science, the greater was the heat and impatience of his thirst, so that, before the first year of his confinement had well gone round, there was scarce a fortified town in
<em>Italy</em>
or
<em>Flanders,</em>
of which, by one means or other, he had not procured a plan, reading over as he got them, and carefully collating therewith the histories of their sieges, their demolitions, their improvements, and new works, all which he would read with that intense application and delight, that he would forget himself, his wound, his confinement, his dinner.

<p>

Towards the beginning of the third year, which was in
<em>August,</em>
ninety-nine, my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
found it necessary to understand a little of projectiles:


---And having judged it best to draw his knowledge from the fountain-head, he began with
<em>N. Tartaglia,</em>
who it seems was the first man who detected the imposition of a canon-ball's doing all that mischief under the notion of a right line.


---This
<em>N. Tartaglia</em>
proved to my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
to be an impossible thing.

<br>

<p>
---------Endless is the Search of Truth! 
</p> 
<p>

No sooner was my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
satisfied which road the cannon-ball did not go, but he was insensibly led on, and resolved in his mind to enquire and find out which road the ball did go:


For which purpose he was obliged to set off afresh with old
<em>Maltus,</em>
and studied him devoutly.


<ps>
---He proceeded next to
<em>Gallileo</em>
and
<em>Torricellius,</em>
wherein, by certain geometrical rules, infallibly laid down, he found the precise path to be a
<strong>Parabola,</strong>
---or else an
<strong>Hyperbola,</strong>
---and that the parameter, or
<em>latus rectum,</em>
of the conic section of the said path was to the quantity and amplitude in a direct
<em>ratio,</em>
as the whole line to the sine of double the angle of incidence, form'd by the breech upon an horizontal plane;---and that the semi-parameter,

------stop! my dear uncle
<em>Toby,</em>
---stop!---go not one foot farther into this thorny and bewilder'd track,--- intricate are the steps! intricate are the mases of this labyrinth! intricate are the troubles which the pursuit of this bewitching phantom,
<strong>Knowledge,</strong>
will bring upon thee.

---O my uncle! fly---fly--- fly from it as from a serpent. 
---Is it fit, good-natur'd man! thou should'st sit up, with the wound upon thy groin, whole nights baking thy blood with hectic watchings? 
---Alas! 'twill exasperate thy symptoms,---check thy perspirations,--- evaporate thy spirits,---waste thy animal strength,---dry up thy radical moisture, ---bring thee into a costive habit of body, impair thy health,---and hasten all the infirmities of thy old age.

Would not give a groat for that man's knowledge in pen-craft, who does not understand this,---That the best plain narrative in the world, tack'd very close to the last spirited apostrophe to my uncle

------Writers of my stamp have one principle in common with painters.

In the latter end of the third year, my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
perceiving that the parameter and semi-parameter of the conic section angred his wound, he left off the study of projectiles in a kind of a huff, and betook himself to the practical part of fortification only; the pleasure of which, like a spring held back, returned upon him with redoubled force.

</p> 
<p>


<ps>It was in this year that my uncle began to break in upon the daily regularity of a clean shirt------to dismiss his barber unshaven,---and to allow his surgeon </ps>

<ps>scarce time sufficient to dress his wound, concerning himself so little about it, as not to ask him once in seven times dressing how it went on: </ps>

When, lo!---all of a sudden, for the change was as quick as lightening, he began to sigh heavily for his recovery,---complain'd to my father, grew impatient with the surgeon;---and one morning as he heard his foot coming up stairs, he shut up his books, and thrust aside his instruments, in order to expostulate with him upon the protraction of his cure, which, he told him, might surely have been accomplished at least by that time: 
---He dwelt long upon the miseries he had undergone, and the sorrows of his four years melancholy imprisonment;---adding, that had it not been for the kind looks, and fraternal cheerings of the best of brothers,---he had long since sunk under his misfortunes.

---My uncle
<em>Toby,</em>
by nature, was not eloquent;--- it had the greater effect.


---The surgeon was confounded;---not that there wanted grounds for such, or greater, marks of impatience,---but 'twas unexpected too; in the four years he had attended him, he had never seen any thing like it in my uncle
<em>Toby's</em>
carriage;---he had never once dropp'd one fretful or discontented word;---he had been all patience,---all submission.

</p> 
<p>
---We lose the right of complaining sometimes by forbearing it;------but we oftner treble the force:

The desire of life and health is implanted in man's nature;---the love of liberty and enlargement is a sister-passion to it: 

These my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
had in common with his species;---and either of them had been sufficient to account for his earnest desire to get well and out of doors;---but I have told you before that nothing wrought with our family after the common way;---and from the time and manner in which this eager desire shew'd itself in the present case, the penetrating reader will suspect there was some other cause or crotchet for it in my uncle
<em>Toby's</em>
head:

---There was so, and 'tis the subject of the next chapter to set forth what that cause and crotchet was.

The sound of as many olympiads twelve hours before, would have convey'd an idea of shorter duration to my uncle

his man, to pack up a bundle of lint and dressings, and hire a chariot and four to be at the door exactly by twelve o'clock that day, when he knew my father would be upon 'Change.

pri'thee see what confusion I have here been making.


---I must have some better contrivance,

--- Can'st not thou take my rule and measure the length and breadth of this table, and then go and bespeak me one as big again? 

---Yes, an' please your Honour, replied

making a bow;---but I hope your Honour will be soon well enough to get down to your country seat, where,---as your Honour takes so much pleasure in fortification, we could manage this matter to a T.

I must here inform you, that this servant of my uncle
<em>Toby's,</em>
who went by the name of
<em>Trim,</em>
had been a Corporal in my uncle's own company,---his real name was
<em>James Butler,</em>
---but having got the nick-name of
<em>Trim</em>
in the regiment, my uncle
<em>Toby,</em>
unless when he happened to be very angry with him, would never call him by any other name.

</p> 
<p>


<ps>
The poor fellow had been disabled for the service, by a wound on his left knee by a musket-bullet, at the battle of
<em>Landen,</em>
which was two years before the affair of
<em>Namur</em>
;---and as the fellow was well beloved in the regiment, and a handy fellow into the bargain, my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
took him for his servant, and of excellent use was he, attending my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
in the camp and in his quarters as valet, groom, barber, cook, sempster,

<ps>and nurse; and indeed, from first to last, waited upon him and served him with great fidelity and affection. </ps>


</p> 
<p>

My uncle
<em>Toby</em>
loved the man in return, and what attached him more to him still, was the similitude of their knowledge:


---For Corporal
<em>Trim,</em>
(for so, for the future, I shall call him) by four years occasional attention to his Master's discourse upon fortified towns, and the advantage of prying and peeping continually into his Master's plans,
<em>&amp;c.</em>
exclusive and besides what he gained
<strong>Hobby-Horsically,</strong>
as a body-servant,
<em>Non Hobby-Horsical per se</em>
;---had become no mean proficient in the science; and was thought, by the cook and chamber-maid, to know as much of the nature of strong-holds as my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
himself.

<p>

I have but one more stroke to give to finish Corporal
<em>Trim's</em>
character,---and it is the only dark line in it.


---The fellow lov'd to advise,---or rather to hear himself talk; his carriage, however, was so perfectly respectful, 'twas easy to keep him silent when you had him so; but set his tongue a-going,---you had no hold of him;---he was voluble;---the eternal interlardings of

with the respectfulness of Corporal

manner, interceding so strong in behalf of his elocution,---that tho' you might have been incommoded,---you could not well be angry.

your Honour might sit out of doors, and give me the nography---(call it ichnography, quoth my uncle)---of the town or citadel, your Honour was pleased to sit down before,---and I will be shot by your Honour upon the glacis of it, if I did not fortify it to your Honour's mind.

---I would begin with the foss&eacute;, and if your Honour could tell me the proper depth and breadth,---I can to a hair's breadth,

replied my uncle,--- I would throw out the earth upon this hand towards the town for the scarp,--- and on that hand towards the campaign for the counterscarp.


---Very right,

<em>St. Nicolas's Gate</em>
) and facilitate the passage over it.

Your Honour understands these matters, replied Corporal
<em>Trim,</em>
better than any officer in his Majesty's service;--- but would your Honour please to let the bespeaking of the table alone, and let us but go into the country, I would work under your Honour's directions like a horse, and make fortifications for you something like a tansy, with all their batteries, saps, ditches, and palisadoes, that it should be worth all the world's riding twenty miles to go and see it.

had a little neat country-house of his own, in the village where my father's estate lay at

which had been left him by an old uncle, with a small estate of about one hundred pounds a year.


<ps>Behind this house, and contiguous to it, was a kitchen-garden of about half an acre;---and at the bottom of the garden, and cut off from it by a tall yew hedge, was a bowling-green, containing just about as much </ps>

ground as Corporal

wished for;--- so that as
<em>Trim</em>
uttered the words, "A rood and a half of ground to do what they would with:"---this identical bowling-green instantly presented itself, and became curiously painted, all at once, upon the retina of my uncle
<em>Toby's</em>
fancy; ---which was the physical cause of making him change colour, or at least, of heightening his blush to that immoderate degree I spoke of.
</ps>


</p> 
<p>


<ps>
Never did lover post down to a belov'd mistress with more heat and expectation, than my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
did, to enjoy this self-same thing in private;---I say in private; ---for it was sheltered from the house, as I told you, by a tall yew hedge, and was covered on the other three sides, from mortal sight, by rough holly and thickset flowering shrubs;---so that the

idea of not being seen, did not a little contribute to the idea of pleasure preconceived in my uncle

mind.
</ps>


--- Vain thought! however thick it was planted about,---or private soever it might seem,---to think, dear uncle
<em>Toby,</em>
of enjoying a thing which took up a whole rood and a half of ground,---and not have it known!

</p> 
<p>

How my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
and Corporal
<em>Trim</em>
managed this matter,---with the history of their campaigns, which were no way barren of events,---may make no uninteresting under-plot in the epitasis and working up of this drama.

---At present the scene must drop,---and change for the parlour fire-side.

---What can they be doing, brother? said my father. 

---I think, replied my uncle
<em>Toby,</em>
---taking, as I told you, his pipe from his mouth, and striking the ashes out of it as he began his sentence;---I think, replied he,---it would not be amiss, brother, if we rung the bell.

It is very strange, says my father, addressing himself to my uncle

shut the door,---as there is so expert an operator as Dr.

<strong>Tho'</strong>
my father was a good natural philosopher,---yet he was something of a moral philosopher too; for which reason, when his tobacco-pipe snapp'd short in the middle,---he had nothing to do,---as such,---but to have taken hold of the two pieces, and thrown them gently upon the back of the fire.

--- He did no such thing;---he threw them with all the violence in the world;---and, to give the action still more emphasis,--- he started up upon both his legs to do it.

This look'd something like heat;--- and the manner of his reply to what my uncle

<strong>It</strong>
is about an hour and a half's tolerable good reading since my uncle

rung the bell, when
<em>Obadiah</em>
was order'd to saddle a horse, and go for Dr.

the man-midwife;---so that no one can say, with reason, that I have not allowed

time enough, poetically speaking, and considering the emergency too, both to go and come;------tho', morally and truly speaking, the man, perhaps, has scarce had time to get on his boots.

Pray, Sir, let me interest you a moment in this description.

<p>

Had Dr.

beheld

<br>

<ps>
that is, of
<em>Obadiah</em>
and the coach-horse.
</ps>

------In my idea, the vortex alone of 'em was enough to have involved and carried, if not the doctor, at least the doctor's pony quite away with it. 

What then do you think must the terror and hydrophobia of Dr.
<em>Slop</em>
have been, when you read (which you are just going to do) that he was advancing thus warily along towards
<em><a href='#Hit50' class='hitmarker' title='View previous hit'><i class="icon-caret-left"></i></a><a name='Hit51'></a><span class="hit">Shandy</span><a href='#Hit52' class='hitmarker' title='View next hit'><i class="icon-caret-right"></i></a>-Hall,</em>
and had approach'd to within sixty yards of it, and within five yards of a sudden turn, made by an acute angle of the garden wall, ---and in the dirtiest part of a dirty lane, ---when
<em>Obadiah</em>
and his coach-horse turn'd the corner, rapid, furious,---pop, ---full upon him!


---Nothing, I think, in nature, can be supposed more terrible, than such a rencounter,---so imprompt! so ill prepared to stand the shock of it as Dr.
<em>Slop</em>
was!

<p>

What could Dr.
<em>Slop</em>
do?

---He cross'd himself &#134; ---Pugh!---but the doctor, Sir, was a Papist. 
---No matter; he had better have kept hold of the pummel. 
He had so;---nay, as it happened, he had better have done nothing at all;---for in crossing himself he let go his whip,--- and in attempting to save his whip betwixt his knee and his saddle's skirt, as it slipp'd, he lost his stirrup,---in losing which, he lost his seat;---and in the multitude of all these losses (which, by the bye, shews what little advantage there is in crossing) the unfortunate doctor lost his presence of mind. 

<ps>
So that, without waiting for
<em>Obadiah's</em>
onset, he left his pony to its destiny, tumbling off it diagonally, something in the stile and manner of a pack of wool, and without any other consequence from the fall, save that of being left (as it would have been)

<ps>with the broadest part of him sunk about twelve inches deep in the mire. </ps>


</p> 
<p>


<em>Obadiah</em>
pull'd off his cap twice to Dr.
<em>Slop</em>
;---once as he was falling,---and then again when he saw him seated.

---Ill-timed complaisance!---had not the fellow better have stopp'd his horse, and got off and help'd him? 

---Sir, he did all that his situation would allow;---but the
<strong>Momentum</strong>
of the coach-horse was so great, that
<em>Obadiah</em>
could not do it all at once;---he rode in a circle three times round Dr.
<em>Slop,</em>
before he could fully accomplish it any how;---and at the last, when he did stop his beast, 'twas done with such an explosion of mud, that
<em>Obadiah</em>
had better have been a league off.


In short, never was a Dr.
<em>Slop</em>
so beluted, and so transubstantiated, since that affair came into fashion.

<strong>When</strong>
Dr.
<em>Slop</em>
entered the back-parlour, where my father and my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
were discoursing upon the nature of women,---it was hard to determine whether Dr.
<em>Slop's</em>
figure, or Dr.
<em>Slop's</em>
presence, occasioned more surprize to them; for as the accident happened so near the house, as not to make it worth while for
<em>Obadiah</em>
to remount him,---
<em>Obadiah</em>
had led him in as he was,
<em>unwiped, unappointed, unanealed,</em>
with all his stains and blotches on him.


------ He stood like
<em>Hamlet's</em>
ghost, motionless and speechless, for a full minute and a half, at the parlour door (
<em>Obadiah</em>
still holding his hand) with all the majesty of mud.


<ps>His hinder parts, upon which he had received his fall, totally </ps>

<br>

<ps>
besmear'd,---and in every other part of him, blotched over in such a manner with
<em>Obadiah's</em>
explosion, that you would have sworn (without mental reservation) that every grain of it had taken effect.
</ps>


</p> 
<p>

Here was a fair opportunity for my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
to have triumph'd over my father in his turn;---for no mortal, who had beheld Dr.
<em>Slop</em>
in that pickle, could have dissented from so much, at least, of my uncle
<em>Toby's</em>
opinion, "That mayhap his sister might not care to let such a Dr.
<em>Slop</em>
come so near her

<img align="top" src="/images/inline/ast.gif">
<img align="top" src="/images/inline/ast.gif">
<img align="top" src="/images/inline/ast.gif">
"


But it was the
<em>Argumentum ad hominem</em>
; and if my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
was not very expert at it, you may think, he might not care to use it.

--- No; the reason was,---'twas not his nature to insult.

<br>

<p>

Dr.
<em>Slop's</em>
presence, at that time, was no less problematical than the mode of it; tho', it is certain, one moment's reflection in my father might have solved it; for he had apprized Dr.
<em>Slop</em>
but the week before, that my mother was at her full reckoning; and as the doctor had heard nothing since, 'twas natural and very political too in him, to have taken a ride to
<em><a href='#Hit51' class='hitmarker' title='View previous hit'><i class="icon-caret-left"></i></a><a name='Hit52'></a><span class="hit">Shandy</span><a href='#Hit53' class='hitmarker' title='View next hit'><i class="icon-caret-right"></i></a>-Hall,</em>
as he did, merely to see how matters went on.

</p> 
<p>


<ps>But my father's mind took unfortunately a wrong turn in the investigation; running, like the hypercritic's, altogether upon the ringing of the bell and the rap upon the door,---measuring their distance, ---and keeping his mind so intent upon the operation, as to have power to think of nothing else,---common-place infirmity of the greatest mathematicians! </ps>

<br>

<ps>working with might and main at the demonstration, and so wasting all their strength upon it, that they have none left in them to draw the corollary, to do good with. </ps>


</p> 
<p>

The ringing of the bell and the rap upon the door, struck likewise strong upon the sensorium of my uncle
<em>Toby,</em>
--- but it excited a very different train of thoughts;---the two irreconcileable pulsations instantly brought
<em>Stevinus,</em>
the great engineer, along with them, into my uncle
<em>Toby's</em>
mind:


---What business
<em>Stevinus</em>
had in this affair,---is the greatest problem of all;---it shall be solved,--- but not in the next chapter.

<strong>Writing,</strong>
when properly managed, (as you may be sure I think mine is) is but a different name for conversation:

As no one, who knows what he is about in good company, would venture to talk all;---so no author, who understands the just boundaries of decorum and good breeding, would presume to think all: 
The truest respect which you can pay to the reader's understanding, is to halve this matter amicably, and leave him something to imagine, in his turn, as well as yourself. 
</p> 
<p>
For my own part, I am eternally paying him compliments of this kind, and do all that lies in my power to keep his imagination as busy as my own.

---Then, added my father, making use of the argument

---I will lay twenty guineas to a single crown piece, (which will serve to give away to

<em>Stevinus</em>
was some engineer or other,--- or has wrote something or other, either directly or indirectly, upon the science of fortification.

</p> 
<p>

He has so,---replied my uncle

--- I knew it, said my father;---tho', for the soul of me, I cannot see what kind of connection there can be betwixt Dr.

sudden coming, and a discourse upon fortification;---yet I fear'd it.

the critic could not detest and abhor a pun, or the insinuation of a pun, more cordially than my father;---he would grow testy upon it at any time;--- but to be broke in upon by one, in a serious discourse, was as bad, he would say, as a fillip upon the nose;---he saw no difference.

---But the
<em>curtin,</em>
Sir, is the word we use in fortification, for that part of the wall or rampart which lies between the two bastions and joins them.


---Besiegers seldom offer to carry on their attacks directly against the curtin, for this reason, because they are so well
<em>flanked</em>
.


('Tis the case of other curtins, quoth Dr.
<em>Slop,</em>
laughing).


However, continued my uncle
<em>Toby,</em>
to make them sure, we generally choose to place ravelins before them, taking care only to extend them beyond the foss&eacute; or ditch:


<ps>---The common men, who know very little of fortification, confound the ravelin and the half-moon together,---tho' they are very different things;---not in their figure or </ps>

<br>

<ps>construction, for we make them exactly alike in all points;---for they always consist of two faces, making a salient angle, with the gorges, not straight, but in form of a crescent. </ps>

---Where then lies the difference? (quoth my father, a little testily). 

---In their situations, answered my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
:

---For when a ravelin, brother, stands before the curtin, it is a ravelin; and when a ravelin stands before a bastion, then the ravelin is not a ravelin; ---it is a half-moon;---a half-moon likewise is a half-moon, and no more, so long as it stands before its bastion;---but was it to change place, and get before the curtin,---'twould be no longer a half-moon; a half-moon, in that case, is not a half-moon;---'tis no more than a ravelin. 
---I think, quoth my father, that the noble science of defence has its weak sides,---as well as others.

---As for the horn-works (high! ho! sigh'd my father) which, continued my uncle
<em>Toby,</em>
my brother was speaking of, they are a very considerable part of an outwork;---they are called by the
<em>French</em>
engineers,
<em>Ouvrage &agrave; corne,</em>
and we generally make them to cover such places as we suspect to be weaker than the rest;--- 'tis form'd by two epaulments or demi-bastions, ---they are very pretty, and if you will take a walk, I'll engage to shew you one well worth your trouble.


<ps>
------I own, continued my uncle

when we crown them,---they are much stronger, but then they are very expensive, and take up a great deal of ground; so that, in my opinion, they are most of use to cover or defend the head of a camp; otherwise the double tenaille---By the mother who bore us!---brother

---And will add here, that where just occasions presented, or called it forth,---I know no man under whose arm I would sooner have taken shelter; nor did this arise from any insensibility or obtuseness of his intellectual parts;--- for he felt this insult of my father's as feelingly as a man could do;---but he was of a peaceful, placid nature,---no jarring element in it,---all was mix'd up so kindly within him; my uncle

And tho' I would not depreciate what the study of the

My father, in this patient endurance of wrongs, which I mention, was very different, as the reader must long ago have noted; he had a much more acute and quick sensibility of nature, attended with a little soreness of temper; tho' this never transported him to any thing which looked like malignancy;------yet, in the little rubs and vexations of life, 'twas apt to shew itself in a drollish and witty kind of peevishness:

to whom he was addressing his discourse, and look'd up into my father's face, with a countenance spread over with so much good nature;---so placid;---so fraternal;---so inexpressibly tender towards him;---it penetrated my father to his heart:


He rose up hastily from his chair, and seizing hold of both my uncle
<em>Toby's</em>
hands as he spoke.


--- Brother
<em>Toby,</em>
said he,---I beg thy pardon; ---forgive, I pray thee, this rash humour which my mother gave me.

the end of the last chapter, my father and my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
were left both standing, like
<em>Brutus</em>
and
<em>Cassius</em>
at the close of the scene making up their accounts.

<p>

As my father spoke the three last words, ---he sat down;---my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
exactly followed his example, only, that before he took his chair, he rung the bell, to order Corporal
<em>Trim,</em>
who was in waiting, to step home for
<em>Stevinus</em>
;---my uncle
<em>Toby's</em>
house being no farther off than the opposite side of the way.

</p> 
<p>

Some men would have dropp'd the subject of
<em>Stevinus</em>
;---but my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
had no resentment in his heart, and he went on with the subject, to shew my father that he had none.

</p> 
<p>

Your sudden appearance, Dr.
<em>Slop,</em>
quoth my uncle, resuming the discourse, instantly brought
<em>Stevinus</em>
into my head.

(My father, you may be sure, did not offer to lay any more wagers upon
<em>Stevinus's</em>
head)---Because, continued my

<ps>
uncle
<em>Toby,</em>
the celebrated sailing chariot, which belonged to Prince
<em>Maurice,</em>
and was of such wonderful contrivance and velocity, as to carry half a dozen people thirty
<em>German</em>
miles, in I don't know how few minutes,---was invented by
<em>Stevinus,</em>
that great mathematician and engineer.
</ps>


</p> 
<p>

You might have spared your servant the trouble, quoth Dr.
<em>Slop</em>
(as the fellow is lame) of going for
<em>Stevinus's</em>
account of it, because, in my return from
<em>Leyden</em>
thro' the
<em>Hague,</em>
I walked as far as
<em>Schevling,</em>
which is two long miles, on purpose to take a view of it.

</p> 
<p>


<ps>
---That's nothing, replied my uncle
<em>Toby,</em>
to what the learned
<em>Peireskius</em>
did, who walked a matter of five hundred miles, reckoning from
<em>Paris</em>
to
<em>Schevling,</em>

</ps>

<br>

<ps>
and from
<em>Schevling</em>
to
<em>Paris</em>
back again, in order to see it,---and nothing else.
</ps>


</p> 
<p>
Some men cannot bear to be out-gone. 
</p> 
<p>

The more fool
<em>Peireskius,</em>
replied Dr.
<em>Slop</em>
.


But mark, 'twas out of no contempt of
<em>Peireskius</em>
at all;---but that
<em>Peireskius's</em>
indefatigable labour in trudging so far on foot out of love for the sciences, reduced the exploit of Dr.
<em>Slop,</em>
in that affair, to nothing;---the more fool
<em>Peireskius,</em>
said he again:

---Why so?--- replied my father, taking his brother's part, not only to make reparation as fast as he could for the insult he had given him, which sat still upon my father's mind;---but partly, that my father began really to interest himself in the discourse. 
---Why so?---said he. 

<ps>
Why is
<em>Peireskius,</em>
or any man else, to be abused for an appetite

<br>

<ps>for that, or any other morsel of sound knowledge? </ps>

For, notwithstanding I know nothing of the chariot in question, continued he, the inventor of it must have had a very mechanical head; and tho' I cannot guess upon what principles of philosophy he has atchiev'd it;---yet certainly his machine has been constructed upon solid ones, be they what they will, or it could not have answer'd at the rate my brother mentions. 
</p> 
<p>

It answered, replied my uncle
<em>Toby,</em>
as well, if not better; for, as
<em>Peireskius</em>
elegantly expresses it, speaking of the velocity of its motion,
<em>Tam citus erat, quam erat ventus</em>
; which, unless I have forgot my Latin, is,
<em>that it was as swift as the wind itself</em>
.

<br>

<p>

But pray, Dr.
<em>Slop,</em>
quoth my father, interrupting my uncle (tho' not without begging pardon for it, at the same time) upon what principles was this self-same chariot set a-going?


---Upon very pretty principles to be sure, replied Dr.
<em>Slop</em>
;---and I have often wondered, continued he, evading the question, why none of our gentry, who live upon large plains like this of ours,---(especially they whose wives are not past child-bearing) attempt nothing of this kind; for it would not only be infinitely expeditious upon sudden calls, to which the sex is subject,---if the wind only served,---but would be excellent good husbandry to make use of the winds, which cost nothing, and which eat nothing, rather than horses, which (the devil take 'em) both cost and eat and great deal.

<br>

<p>
For that very reason, replied my father, "Because they cost nothing, and because they eat nothing,"---the scheme is bad;---it is the consumption of our products, as well as the manufacture of them, which gives bread to the hungry, circulates trade,---brings in money, and supports the value of our lands;---and tho', I own, if I was a prince, I would generously recompense the scientific head which brought forth such contrivances; ---yet I would as peremptorily suppress the use of them. 
</p> 
<p>


<ps>
My father here had got into his element, ---and was going on as prosperously with his dissertation upon trade, as my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
had before, upon his of fortification;---but, to the loss of much sound knowledge, the destinies in the morning had decreed that no

:

---But 'twas too late,---all the discourse had been exhausted without him, and was running into a new channel.

<p>

---You may take the book home again,
<em>Trim,</em>
said my uncle
<em>Toby,</em>
nodding to him.

<p>
But pri'thee, Corporal, quoth my father, drolling,---look first into it, and see if thou canst spy aught of a sailing chariot in it.

Corporal
<em>Trim,</em>
by being in the service, had learned to obey,---and not to remonstrate; ---so taking the book to a side-table, and running over the leaves; an' please your Honour, said
<em>Trim,</em>
I can see no such thing;---however, continued the Corporal, drolling a little in his turn, I'll make sure work of it, an' please your Honour;---so taking hold of the two covers of the book, one in each hand, and letting the leaves fall down, as he bent the covers back, he gave the book a good sound shake.

</p> 
<p>

There is something fallen out, however, said
<em>Trim,</em>
an' please your Honour; but it is not a chariot, or any thing like one:

---Pri'thee Corporal, said my father, smiling, what is it then? 

<ps>
---I think, answered
<em>Trim,</em>
stooping to take it up,--- 'tis more like a sermon,---for it begins,

<ps>with a text of scripture, and the chapter and verse;---and then goes on, not as a chariot,---but like a sermon directly. </ps>


</p> 
<p>
The company smiled. 
</p> 
<p>

I cannot conceive how it is possible, quoth my uncle
<em>Toby,</em>
for such a thing as a sermon to have got into my
<em>Stevinus</em>
.

</p> 
<p>

I think 'tis a sermon, replied
<em>Trim</em>
;--- but if it please your Honours, as it is a fair hand, I will read you a page;---for
<em>Trim,</em>
you must know, loved to hear himself read almost as well as talk.

</p> 
<p>


<ps>
I have ever a strong propensity, said my father, to look into things which cross my way, by such strange fatalities as these;---and as we have nothing better to do, at least till
<em>Obadiah</em>
gets back,

I should be obliged to you, brother, if Dr.
<em>Slop</em>
has no objection to it, to order the Corporal to give us a page or two of it,---if he is as able to do it, as he seems willing.
</ps>


An' please your Honour, quoth
<em>Trim,</em>
I officiated two whole campaigns in
<em>Flanders,</em>
as clerk to the chaplain of the regiment.


---He can read it, quoth my uncle
<em>Toby,</em>
as well as I can.


---
<em>Trim,</em>
I assure you, was the best scholar in my company, and should have had the next halberd, but for the poor fellow's misfortune.


Corporal
<em>Trim</em>
laid his hand upon his heart, and made an humble bow to his master;---then laying down his hat upon the floor, and taking up the sermon in his left-hand, in order to have his right at liberty,---he advanced, nothing doubting, into the middle of the room, where he could best see, and be best seen by, his audience.

Not in the least, replied Dr.

---But before the Corporal begins, I must first give you a description of his attitude;------otherwise he will naturally stand represented, by your imagination, in an uneasy posture,---stiff,---perpendicular, ---dividing the weight of his body equally upon both legs;---his eye fix'd, as if on duty;---his look determined,--- clinching the sermon in his left-hand, like his firelock: 

---In a word, you would be apt to paint
<em>Trim,</em>
as if he was standing in his platoon ready for action:

--- His attitude was as unlike all this as you can conceive.

<p>
He stood before them with his body swayed, and bent forwards just so far, as to make an angle of 85 degrees and a half upon the plain of the horizon;--- which sound orators, to whom I address this, know very well, to be the true persuasive angle of incidence;---in any other angle you may talk and preach;---'tis certain,---and it is done every day;--- but with what effect,---I leave the world to judge! 
</p> 
<p>
The necessity of this precise angle of 85 degrees and a half to a mathematical exactness,---does it not shew us, by the way,---how the arts and sciences mutually befriend each other?

How the duce Corporal
<em>Trim,</em>
who knew not so much as an acute angle from an obtuse one, came to hit it so exactly;

shall be commented upon in that part of this cyclop&aelig;dia of arts and sciences, where the instrumental parts of the eloquence of the senate, the pulpit, the bar, the coffee-house, the bed-chamber, and fire-side, fall under consideration.
</ps>


</p> 
<p>


<ps>He stood,---for I repeat it, to take the picture of him in at one view, with his body sway'd, and somewhat bent forwards, ---his right-leg firm under him, sustaining seven-eighths of his whole weight,---the foot of his left-leg, the defect of which was no disadvantage to his attitude, advanced a little,---not laterally, nor forwards, but in a line betwixt them;---his knee bent, but that not violently, ---but so as to fall within the limits of the line of beauty;---and I add, </ps>

<br>

<ps>of the line of science too;---for consider, it had one eighth part of his body to bear up;---so that in this case the position of the leg is determined,---because the foot could be no further advanced, or the knee more bent, than what would allow him mechanically, to receive an eighth part of his whole weight under it,---and to carry it too. </ps>


</p> 
<p>
&lt;-This I recommend to painters?--- need I add,---to orators? 
---I think not; for, unless they practise it,---they must fall upon their noses. 
</p> 
<p>

So much for Corporal
<em>Trim's</em>
body and legs.


<ps>---He held the sermon loosely,---not carelessly, in his left-hand, raised something above his stomach, and detach'd a little from his breast;---his right-arm falling negligently by his side, as nature </ps>

<ps>and the laws of gravity ordered it,---but with the palm of it open and turned towards his audience, ready to aid the sentiment, in case it stood in need. </ps>


</p> 
<p>

Corporal
<em>Trim's</em>
eyes and the muscles of his face were in full harmony with the other parts of him;---he look'd frank,--- unconstrained,---something assured,--- but not bordering upon assurance.

</p> 
<p>


<ps>
Let not the critic ask how Corporal
<em>Trim</em>
could come by all this; I've told him it shall be explained;---but so he stood before my father, my uncle
<em>Toby,</em>
and Dr.

But from whence, replied my father, have you concluded so soon, Dr.
<em>Slop,</em>
that the writer is of our Church?---for aught I can see yet,---he may be of any Church:


---Because, answered Dr.
<em>Slop,</em>
if he was of ours,---he durst no more take such a licence,---than a bear by his beard:

---No matter for that, answered Dr.

---it has its uses; for tho' I'm no great advocate for it, yet in such a case as this, he would soon be taught better manners; and I can tell him, if he went on at that rate, would be flung into the Inquisition for his pains.

went over a servant to

widow, who kept a small shop, and sold sausages, which, some how or other, was the cause of his being taken in the middle of the night out of his bed, where he was lying with his wife and two small children, and carried directly to the Inquisition, where, God help him, continued

that the towers, in

days, were not such things as our bastions, flank'd and defended by other works;---this,
<em>Trim,</em>
was an invention since
<em>Solomon's</em>
death; nor had they horn-works, or ravelins before the curtin, in his time;---or such a foss&eacute; as we make with a curvette in the middle of it, and with cover'd ways and counterscarps palisadoed along it, to guard against a
<em>Coup de main</em>

---So that the seven men upon the tower were a party, I dare say, from the

set there, not only to look out, but to defend it.

"To have the fear of God before our eyes, and, in our mutual dealings with each other, to govern our actions by the eternal measures of right and wrong: 

--- The first of these will comprehend the duties of religion;---the second, those of morality, which are so inseparably connected together, that you cannot divide these two
<em>tables,</em>
even in imagination (tho' the attempt is often made in practice) without breaking and mutually destroying them both.

<ps>more common than to see a man who has no sense at all of religion,---and indeed has so much honesty as to pretend to none, who would take it as the bitterest affront, should you but hint at a suspicion of his moral character,--- or imagine he was not conscientiously just and scrupulous to the uttermost mite. </ps>


</p> 
<p>
"When there is some appearance that it is so,---tho' one is unwilling even to suspect the appearance of so amiable a virtue as moral honesty, yet were we to look into the grounds of it, in the present case, I am persuaded we should find little reason to envy such a one the honour of his motive.

"I know the banker I deal with, or the physician I usually call in," [There is no need, cried Dr.

(waking) to call in any physician in this case] "to be neither of them men of much religion:

I hear them make a jest of it every day, and treat all its sanctions with so much scorn, as to put the matter past doubt.

<ps>I trust my life to the honest skill of the other. </ps>


</p> 
<p>
"Now, let me examine what is my reason for this great confidence. 
------ Why, in the first place, I believe there is no probability that either of them will employ the power I put into their hands to my disadvantage;---I consider that honesty serves the purposes of this life: 
---I know their success in the world depends upon the fairness of their characters. 
---In a word,---I'm persuaded that they cannot hurt me, without hurting themselves more.

---In this case, what hold have I of either of them? 
---Religion, the strongest of all motives, is out of the question: 
---Interest, the next most powerful motive in the world, is strongly against me: 
--- What have I left to cast into the opposite scale to balance this temptation? 

--- Alas! I have nothing,---nothing but what is lighter than a bubble---I must lye at the mercy of
<strong>Honour,</strong>
or some such capricious principle.

---Strait security for two of my most valuable blessings! ---my property and my life.

<ps>nothing better to be expected from religion without morality;---nevertheless, 'tis no prodigy to see a man whose real moral character stands very low, who yet entertains the highest notion of himself, in the light of a religious man. </ps>

<p>
"He shall not only be covetous, revengeful, implacable,---but even wanting in points of common honesty; yet, inasmuch as he talks aloud against the infidelity of the age,--- is zealous for some points of religion, ---goes twice a day to church, ---attends the sacraments,---and amuses himself with a few instrumental parts of religion,---shall cheat his conscience into a judgment that, for this, he is a religious man, and has discharged truly his duty to God:

And you will find that such a man, through force of this delusion, generally looks down with spiritual pride upon every other man who has less affectation of piety,---though, perhaps, ten times more moral honesty than himself.

"
<em>This likewise is a sore evil under the sun</em>
; and, I believe there is no one mistaken principle, which, for its time, has wrought more serious mischiefs.


--- For a general proof of this,---examine the history of the

church;"--- [Well, what can you make of that, cried Dr.

?]---"see what scenes of cruelty, murders, rapines, blood-shed," [They may thank their own obstinacy, cried Dr.

"
<em>First,</em>
Whenever a man talks loudly against religion,---always suspect that it is not his reason, but his passions which have got the better of his

.

A bad life and a good belief are disagreeable and troublesome neighbours, and where they separate, depend upon it, 'tis for no other cause but quietness sake. 
</p> 
<p>

"
<em>Secondly,</em>
When a man, thus represented, tells you in any particular instance, ---That such a thing goes
<em>against</em>
his conscience,---always believe he means exactly the same thing, as when he tells you such a thing goes
<em>against</em>
his stomach; ---a present want of appetite being generally the true cause of both.

"In a word,---trust that man in nothing, who has not a
<strong>Conscience</strong>
in every thing.

</p> 
<p>
"And, in your own case, remember this plain distinction, a mistake in which has ruined thousands,---that your conscience is not a law: 

---No, God and reason made the law, and have placed conscience within you to determine;---not like an
<em>Asiatic</em>
Cadi, according to the ebbs and flows of his own passions,---but like a
<em>British</em>
judge in this land of liberty and good sense, who makes no new law, but faithfully declares that law which he knows already written."

full as much as his assent, simply, could have pleased him.


---But in this, added Dr.

a little piqued,---our sermons have greatly the advantage, that we never introduce any character into them below a patriarch or a patriarch's wife, or a martyr or a saint.

---How could it get into my

A man must be as great a conjurer as

---The first, I think, is not so difficult;---for unless my judgment greatly deceives me,---I know the author, for 'tis wrote, certainly, by the parson of the parish. 
</p> 
<p>

The similitude of the stile and manner of it, with those my father constantly had heard preach'd in his parish-church, was the ground of his conjecture, ---proving it as strongly, as an argument
<em>&agrave; priori</em>
could prove such a thing to a philosophic mind, that it was
<em>Yorick's</em>
and no one's else:


------ It was proved to be so
<em>&agrave; posteriori,</em>
the day after, when
<em>Yorick</em>
sent a servant to my uncle

house to enquire after it.

It seems that
<em>Yorick,</em>
who was inquisitive after all kinds of knowledge, had borrowed
<em>Stevinus</em>
of my uncle
<em>Toby,</em>
and had carelesly popp'd his sermon, as soon as he had made it, into the middle of
<em>Stevinus</em>
; and, by an act of forgetfulness, to which he was ever subject, he had sent
<em>Stevinus</em>
home, and his sermon to keep him company.

Can the reader believe, that this sermon of
<em>Yorick's</em>
was preach'd at an assize, in the cathedral of
<em>York,</em>
before a thousand witnesses, ready to give oath of it, by a certain prebendary of that church, and actually printed by him when he had done,---and within so short a space as two years and three months after

I have ordered, answered my father, the old midwife to come down to us upon the least difficulty;------for you must know, Dr.

continued my father, with a perplexed kind of a smile upon his countenance, that by express treaty, solemnly ratified between me and my wife, you are no more than an auxiliary in this affair,---and not so much as that,------unless the lean old mother of a midwife above stairs cannot do without you.


---Women have their particular fancies, and in points of this nature, continued my father, where they bear the whole burden, and suffer so much acute pain for the advantage of our families, and the good of the species, ---they claim a right of deciding,

in whose hands, and in what fashion, they chuse to undergo it.

--- I know not, quoth my father, answering a little too testily, to be quite dispassionate in what he said,---I know not, quoth he, what we have left to give up, in lieu of who shall bring our children into the world,---unless that,---of who shall beget them.

<strong>I</strong>
Have dropp'd the curtain over this scene for a minute,---to remind you of one thing,---and to inform you of another.

When these two things are done,---the curtain shall be drawn up again, and my uncle
<em>Toby,</em>
my father, and Dr.
<em>Slop</em>
shall go on with their discourse, without any more interruption.

</p> 
<p>


<ps>First, then, the matter which I have to remind you of, is this;---that from the specimens of singularity in my father's notions in the point of Christian-names, and that other point previous thereto,--- you was led, I think, into an opinion, (and I am sure I said as much) that my father was a gentleman altogether as odd </ps>

<ps>and whimsical in fifty other opinions. </ps>

In truth, there was not a stage in the life of man, from the very first act of his begetting, ---down to the lean and slipper'd pantaloon in his second childishness, but he had some favourite notion to himself, springing out of it, as sceptical, and as far out of the high-way of thinking, as these two which have been explained. 
</p> 
<p>

---Mr.

my father, Sir, would see nothing in the light in which others placed it;---he placed things in his own light;---he would weigh nothing in common scales;---no,---he was too refined a researcher to lye open to so gross an imposition.


<ps>---To come at the exact weight of things in the scientific steel-yard, the fulcrum, he would say, should be almost invisible, to avoid all friction from popular tenets;---without this the minuti&aelig; </ps>

<br>

<ps>of philosophy, which should always turn the balance, will have no weight at all. </ps>


--- Knowledge, like matter, he would affirm, was divisible
<em>in infinitum</em>
;---that the grains and scruples were as much a part of it, as the gravitation of the whole world.

---In a word, he would say, error was error,--- no matter where it fell,---whether in a fraction,---or a pound,---'twas alike fatal to truth, and she was kept down at the bottom of her well as inevitably by a mistake in the dust of a butterfly's wing, ---as in the disk of the sun, the moon, and all the stars of heaven put together. 
</p> 
<p>


<ps>He would often lament that it was for want of considering this properly, and of applying it skilfully to civil matters, as well as to speculative truths, that so many things in this world were out of joint;--- that the political arch was giving way;--- </ps>

You cry out, he would say, we are a ruined, undone people. 

---Why? he would ask, making use of the sorites or syllogism of
<em>Zeno</em>
and
<em>Chrysippus,</em>
without knowing it belonged to them.

---Why? why are we a ruined people? 
---Because we are corrupted. 
---Whence is it, dear Sir, that we are corrupted? 
---Because we are needy;---our poverty, and not our wills, consent. 
--- And wherefore, he would add,---are we needy? 
---From the neglect, he would answer, of our pence and our halfpence: 
--- Our bank-notes, Sir, our guineas,---nay our shillings, take care of themselves.

---The laws of nature will defend themselves;---but error---(he would add, looking earnestly at my mother)---error, Sir, creeps in thro' the minute holes, and small crevices, which human nature leaves unguarded. 
</p> 
<p>
This turn of thinking in my father, is what I had to remind you of: 
---The point you are to be informed of, and which I have reserved for this place, is as follows: 
</p> 
<p>


<ps>
Amongst the many and excellent reasons, with which my father had urged my mother to accept of Dr.
<em>Slop's</em>
assistance preferably to that of the old woman, ---there was one of a very singular nature; which, when he had done arguing the matter with her as a Christian, and came to argue it over again with her

<br>

<ps>as a philosopher, he had put his whole strength to, depending indeed upon it as his sheet anchor. </ps>

---It failed him; tho' from no defect in the argument itself; but that, do what he could, he was not able for his soul to make her comprehend the drift of it. 
---Cursed luck!---said he to himself, one afternoon, as he walk'd out of the room, after he had been stating it for an hour and a half to her, to no manner of purpose;---cursed luck! said he, biting his lip as he shut the door, ---for a man to be master of one of the finest chains of reasoning in nature,--- and have a wife at the same time with such a head-piece, that he cannot hang up a single inference within side of it, to save his soul from destruction. 
</p> 
<p>


<ps>This argument, tho' it was intirely lost upon my mother,---had more weight with </ps>

<br>

<ps>him, than all his other arguments joined together: </ps>

---I will therefore endeavour to do it justice,---and set it forth with all the perspicuity I am master of. 
</p> 
<p>
My father set out upon the strength of these two following axioms: 
</p> 
<p>


<em>First,</em>
That an ounce of a man's own wit, was worth a tun of other peoples; and,

</p> 
<p>


<em>Secondly,</em>
(Which, by the bye, was the ground-work of the first axiom,---tho' it comes last) That every man's wit must come from every man's own soul,---and no other body's.

</p> 
<p>


<ps>Now, as it was plain to my father, that all souls were by nature equal,---and that the great difference between the most acute and the most obtuse understanding, </ps>

<ps>---was from no original sharpness or bluntness of one thinking substance above or below another,---but arose merely from the lucky or unlucky organization of the body, in that part where the soul principally took up her residence,---he had made it the subject of his enquiry to find out the identical place. </ps>


</p> 
<p>


<ps>
Now, from the best accounts he had been able to get of this matter, he was satisfied it could not be where
<em>Des Cartes</em>
had fixed it, upon the top of the
<em>pineal</em>
gland of the brain; which, as he philosophised, formed a cushion for her about the size of a marrow pea; tho' to speak the truth, as so many nerves did terminate all in that one place,---'twas no bad conjecture; ---and my father had certainly fallen with that great philosopher plumb into the center of the mistake, had it not

who rescued him out of it, by a story he told him of a

officer at the battle of
<em>Landen,</em>
who had one part of his brain shot away by a musket-ball,---and another part of it taken out after by a
<em>French</em>
surgeon; and, after all, recovered, and did his duty very well without it.
</ps>


</p> 
<p>
If death, said my father, reasoning with himself, is nothing but the separation of the soul from the body;---and if it is true that people can walk about and do their business without brains,---then certes the soul does not inhabit there. Q.E.D.

of the cerebellum, and which he likewise affirms to be the principal seat of the reasonable soul (for, you must know, in these latter and more enlightened ages, there are two souls in every man living,---the one, according to the great
<em>Metheglingius,</em>
being called the
<em>Animus,</em>
the other the
<em>Anima</em>
);---as for this opinion, I say, of
<em>Borri,</em>
---my father could never subscribe to it by any means; the very idea of so noble, so refined, so immaterial, and so exalted a being as the
<em>Anima,</em>
or even the
<em>Animus,</em>
taking up her residence, and sitting dabbling, like a tad-pole, all day long, both summer and winter, in a puddle,---or in a liquid of any kind, how thick or thin soever, he would say, shock'd his imagination; he would scarce give the doctrine a hearing.

anatomists, that all the minute nerves from all the organs of the seven senses concentered, like streets and winding alleys, into a square.

So far there was nothing singular in my father's opinion,---he had the best of philosophers, of all ages and climates, to go along with him.

<em>Adrianus Smelvgot,</em>
had found out, That the lax and pliable state of a child's head in parturition, the bones of the cranium having no futures at that time, was such,---that by force of the woman's efforts, which, in strong labour-pains, was equal, upon an average, to a weight of 470 pounds averdupoise acting perpendicularly upon it;---it so happened that, in 49 instances out of 50, the said head was compressed and moulded into the shape of an oblong conical piece of dough, such as a pastry-cook generally rolls up in order to make a pye of.
</ps>

--- Good God! cried my father, what havock and destruction must this make in the infinitely fine and tender texture of the cerebellum! 

---Or if there is such a juice as
<em>Borri</em>
pretends,---is it not enough to make the clearest liquor in the world both feculent and mothery?

<p>
But how great was his apprehension, when he further understood, that this force, acting upon the very vertex of the head, not only injured the brain itself or cerebrum,---but that it necessarily squeez'd and propell'd the cerebrum towards the cerebellum, which was the immediate seat of the understanding. 
--- Angels and Ministers of grace defend us! cried my father,---can any soul withstand this shock? 
---No wonder the intellectual web is so rent and tatter'd as we see it; and that so many of our best heads are no better than a puzzled skein of silk,---all perplexity,---all confusion within side. 
</p>

It is the nature of an hypothesis, when once a man has conceived it, that it assimilates every thing to itself as proper nourishment; and, from the first moment of your begetting it, it generally grows the stronger by every thing you see, hear, read, or understand. 
This is of great use.

When my father was gone with this about a month, there was scarce a ph&aelig;nomenon of stupidity or of genius, which he could not readily solve by it;---it accounted for the eldest son being the greatest blockhead in the family. 
---Poor devil, he would say,---he made way for the capacity of his younger brothers.

This incision of the

and

were not mortal;--- so that the belly of the mother might be

---He mentioned the thing one afternoon to my mother,---merely as a matter of fact;---but seeing her turn as pale as ashes at the very mention of it, as much as the operation flattered his hopes,---he thought it as well to say no more of it,---contenting himself with admiring ---what he thought was to no purpose to propose.

<p>

This was my father Mr.

hypothesis; concerning which I have only to add, that my brother
<em>Bobby</em>
did as great honour to it (whatever he did to the family) as any one of the great heroes we spoke of:

<ps>lad of wonderful slow parts,---my father spelt all these together into his opinion; and as he had failed at one end,---he was determined to try the other. </ps>


</p> 
<p>
This was not to be expected from one of the sisterhood, who are not easily to be put out of their way,---and was therefore one of my father's great reasons in favour of a man of science, whom he could better deal with. 
</p> 
<p>


<ps>
Of all men in the world, Dr.
<em>Slop</em>
was the fittest for my father's purpose;---for though his new-invented forceps was the armour he had proved, and what he maintained, to be the safest instrument of deliverance,---yet, it seems, he had scattered a word or two in his book, in favour of the very thing which ran in my father's fancy;---tho' not with a view to the soul's good in extracting by the feet,

</p> 
<p>

This will account for the coalition betwixt my father and Dr.
<em>Slop,</em>
in the ensuing discourse, which went a little hard against my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
.

---In what manner a plain man, with nothing but common sense, could bear up against two such allies in science,---is hard to conceive. 

--- You may conjecture upon it, if you please, ---and whilst your imagination is in motion, you may encourage it to go on, and discover by what causes and effects in nature it could come to pass, that my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
got his modesty by the wound he received upon his groin.

---These, with fifty other points left yet unraveled, you may endeavour to solve if you have time;---but I tell you before-hand it will be in vain, ---for not the sage

My uncle
<em>Toby's</em>
wish did Dr.

a disservice which his heart never intended any man,------Sir, it confounded him--- and thereby putting his ideas first into confusion, and then to flight, he could not rally them again for the soul of him.

</p> 
<p>

In all disputes,---male or female,--- whether for honour, for profit or for love, ---it makes no difference in the case;--- nothing is more dangerous, madam, than a wish coming sideways in this unexpected manner upon a man: the safest way in general to take off the force of the wish, is, for the party wished at, instantly to get up upon his legs---and wish the
<em>wisher</em>
something in return, of pretty near the same value,---so balancing the account upon the spot, you stand as you were--- nay sometimes gain the advantage of the attack by it.

Dr.

did not understand the nature of this defence;---he was puzzled with it, and it put an entire stop to the dispute for four minutes and a half;--- five had been fatal to it:---my father saw the danger---the dispute was one of the most interesting disputes in the world, "Whether the child of his prayers and endeavours should be born without a head or with one:"---he waited to the last moment to allow Dr.
<em>Slop,</em>
in whose behalf the wish was made, his right of returning it; but perceiving, I say, that he was confounded, and continued looking with that perplexed vacuity of eye which puzzled souls generally stare with, ---first in my uncle

<ps>
Brother
<em>Toby,</em>
replied my father, taking his wig from off his head with his right hand, and with his
<em>left</em>
pulling out a striped
<em>India</em>
handkerchief from his right coat pocket, in order to rub his head,

as he argued the point with my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
.---
</ps>


</p> 
<p>
---Now, in this I think my father was much to blame; and I will give you my reasons for it. 
</p> 
<p>

Matters of no more seeming consequence in themselves than, "
<em>Whether my father should have taken off his wig with his right hand or with his left,</em>
---" have divided the greatest kingdoms, and made the crowns of the monarchs who governed them, to totter upon their heads.


<ps>---But need I tell you, Sir, that the circumstances with which every thing in this world is begirt, give every thing in this world its size and shape;---and by tightening it, or relaxing it, this way or that, make the thing to be, what it is--- great---little---good---bad---indifferent </ps>

<br>

<ps>or not indifferent, just as the case happens. </ps>


</p> 
<p>

As my father's
<em>India</em>
handkerchief was in his right coat pocket, he should by no means have suffered his right hand to have got engaged: on the contrary, instead of taking off his wig with it, as he did, he ought to have committed that entirely to the left; and then, when the natural exigency my father was under of rubbing his head, call'd out for his handkerchief, he would have had nothing in the world to have done, but to have put his right hand into his right coat pocket and taken it out;---which he might have done without any violence, or the least ungraceful twist in any one tendon or muscle of his whole body.

</p> 
<p>


<ps>In this case, (unless indeed, my father </ps>

himself, as great and gracefully as he paints, might have painted him as he sat.

</p> 
<p>
Now, as my father managed this matter, ---consider what a devil of a figure my father made of himself. 
</p> 
<p>

---In the latter end of Queen
<em>Anne's</em>
reign, and in the beginning of the reign of King
<em>George</em>
the first---"
<em>Coat pockets were cut very low down in the skirt</em>

------ I need say no more---the father of mischief, had he had been hammering at it a month, could not have contrived a worse fashion for one in my father's situation.

<strong>It</strong>
was not an easy matter in any king's reign, (unless you were as lean a subject as myself) to have forced your hand diagonally, quite across your whole body, so as to gain the bottom of your opposite coat-pocket.


<ps>
---In the year, one thousand seven hundred and eighteen, when this happened, it was extremely difficult; so that when my uncle

discovered the transverse zig-zaggery of my father's approaches towards it, it instantly brought into his mind those he had done duty in, before the gate of St.

---Are these dangers, quoth my uncle

Brother

answered my father, if a child was but fairly begot, and born alive, and healthy, and the mother did well after it,------our forefathers never looked further.

<strong>Whilst</strong>
my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
was whistling Lillabullero to my father,--- Dr.
<em>Slop</em>
was stamping, and cursing and damning at
<em>Obadiah</em>
at a most dreadful rate;---it would have done your heart good, and cured you, Sir, for ever, of the vile sin of swearing to have heard him.

---I am determined therefore to relate the whole affair to you. 
</p> 
<p>


<ps>
When Dr.
<em>Slop's</em>
maid delivered the green bays bag, with her master's instruments in it, to
<em>Obadiah,</em>
she very sensibly exhorted him to put his head and one arm through the strings, and ride with it slung across his body: so undoing the

<ps>bow-knot, to lengthen the strings for him, without any more ado, she helped him on with it. </ps>


However, as this, in some measure, unguarded the mouth of the bag, lest any thing should bolt out in galloping back at the speed
<em>Obadiah</em>
threatened, they consulted to take it off again; and in the great care and caution of their hearts, they had taken the two strings and tied them close (pursing up the mouth of the bag first) with half a dozen hard knots, each of which,
<em>Obadiah,</em>
to make all safe, had twitched and drawn together with all the strength of his body.

</p> 
<p>

This answered all that
<em>Obadiah</em>
and the maid intended; but was no remedy against some evils which neither he or she foresaw.


<ps>The instruments, it seems, as tight as the bag was tied above, had </ps>

<ps>
so much room to play in it, towards the bottom, (the shape of the bag being conical) that
<em>Obadiah</em>
could not make a trot of it, but with such a terrible jingle, what with the

and
<em>squirt,</em>
as would have been enough, had
<em>Hymen</em>
been taking a jaunt that way, to have frightened him out of the country; but when
<em>Obadiah</em>
accelerated this motion, and from a plain trot assayed to prick his coach-horse into a full gallop---by heaven!
</ps>

Sir,---the jingle was incredible. 
</p> 
<p>

As
<em>Obadiah</em>
had a wife and three children.


<ps>---The turpitude of fornication, and the many other political ill consequences of this jingling, never once entered his brain,---he had however his objection, which came home to himself, and weighed with him, as it has oft-times done with </ps>

<strong>As</strong>
<em>Obadiah</em>
loved wind musick preferably to all the instrumental musick he carried with him,---he very considerately set his imagination to work, to contrive and to invent by what means he should put himself in a condition of enjoying it.

In all distresses (except musical) where small cords are wanted,---nothing is so apt to enter a man's head, as his hat-band: ---the philosophy of this is so near the surface---I scorn to enter into it.

-tical,---squirtical, papistical,---and as far as the coach-horse was concerned in it,---caball-istical---and only partly musical;---
<em>Obadiah</em>
made no scruple of availing himself of the first expedient which offered;---so taking hold of the bag and instruments, and griping them hard together with one hand, and with the finger and thumb of the other, putting the end of the hat-band betwixt his teeth, and then slipping his hand down to the middle of it,---he tied and cross-tied them all fast together from one end to the other (as you would cord a trunk) with such a multiplicity of round-abouts and intricate cross turns, with a hard knot at every intersection or point where the strings met,---that Dr.

must have had three fifths of

A sudden trampling in the room above, near my mother's bed, did the proposition the very service I am speaking of. 

By all that's unfortunate, quoth Dr.

unless I make haste, the thing will actually befall me as it is.

<strong>In</strong>
the case of

---by which, in the first place, I would not be understood to mean slip-knots,---because in the course of my life and opinions,--- my opinions concerning them will come in more properly when I mention the catastrophe of my great uncle Mr.

---a little man,---but of high fancy:---he rushed into the duke of
<em>Monmouth's</em>
affair:---nor, secondly, in this place, do I mean that particular species of knots, called bow-knots;--- there is so little address, or skill, or patience, required in the unloosing them, that they are below my giving any opinion at all about them.


<ps>---But by the knots I am speaking of, may it please your reverences to believe, that I mean </ps>

good, honest, devilish tight, hard knots, made

as

made his;--- in which there is no quibbling provision made by the duplication and return of the two ends of the strings through the annulus or noose made by the second

of them---to get them slipp'd and undone by------I hope you apprehend me.

<p>

In the case of these

then, and of the several obstructions, which, may it please your reverences, such knots cast in our way in getting through life--- every hasty man can whip out his penknife and cut through them.

---'Tis wrong. 
Believe me, Sirs, the most virtuous way, and which both reason and conscience dictate---is to take our teeth or our fingers to them.

I shall never get the knots untied as long as I live.

My father had a great respect for

<p>

Had Dr.
<em>Slop</em>
cut any part about him, but his thumb---my father had pass'd it by---his prudence had triumphed: as it was, he was determined to have his revenge.

</p> 
<p>

Small curses, Dr.

---They serve, continued my father, to stir the humours---but carry off none of their acrimony:---for my own part, I seldom swear or curse at all--- I hold it bad---but if I fall into it, by surprize, I generally retain so much presence of mind (right, quoth my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
) as to make it answer my purpose--- that is, I swear on, till I find myself easy.

A wise and a just man however would always endeavour to proportion the vent given to these humours, not only to the degree of them stirring within himself--- but to the size and ill intent of the offence upon which they are to fall.

that such a thing was ever thought of,------ much less executed.

<em>Rome,</em>
a copy of which, my father (who was curious in his collections) had procured out of the leger-book of the church of
<em>Rochester,</em>
writ by
<strong>Ernulphus</strong>
the bishop---with a most affected seriousness of look and voice, which might have cajoled

himself,---he put it into Dr.

<strong>Now</strong>
don't let us give ourselves a parcel of airs, and pretend that the oaths we make free with in this land of liberty of ours are our own; and because we have the spirit to swear them, ---imagine that we have had the wit to invent them too.

which were oaths monarchical, and, considering who made them, not much amiss; and as kings oaths, 'tis not much matter whether they were fish or flesh;---else, I say, there is not an oath, or at least a curse amongst them, which has not been copied over and over again out of

---There is an orientality in his, we cannot rise up to: besides, he is more copious in his invention, ---possess'd more of the excellencies of a swearer,---had such a thorough knowledge of the human frame, its membranes, nerves, ligaments, knittings of the joints, and articulations,--- that when
<em>Ernulphus</em>
cursed,---no part escaped him.


---'Tis true, there is something of a

<br>

<ps>every thing in a light very different from all mankind,---would, after all, never allow this to be an original. </ps>


---He consider'd rather
<em>Ernulphus's</em>
anathema, as an institute of swearing, in which, as he suspected, upon the decline of
<em>swearing</em>
in some milder pontificate,

by order of the succeeding pope, had with great learning and diligence collected together all the laws of it;---for the same reason that

in the decline of the empire, had ordered his chancellor

It is a singular stroke of eloquence (at least it was so, when eloquence flourished at
<em>Athens</em>
and
<em>Rome,</em>
and would be so now, did orators wear mantles) not to mention the name of a thing, when you had the thing about you,
<em>in petto,</em>
ready to produce, pop, in the place you want it.

A scar, an axe, a sword, a pink'd-doublet, a rusty helmet, a pound and a half of pot-ashes in an urn, or a three-halfpenny pickle pot,---but above all, a tender infant royally accoutred.

---And then again, if too old, ---it must have been unwieldy and incommodious to his action,---so as to make him lose by his child almost as much as he could gain by it. 
---Otherwise, when a state orator has hit the precise age to a minute,---hid his BAMBINO in his mantle so cunningly that no mortal could smell it,---and produced it so critically, that no soul could say, it came in by head and shoulders,---Oh, Sirs! it has done wonders.

Now,
<em>Agalastes</em>
(speaking dispraisingly) sayeth, That there may be some wit in it, for aught he knows,---but no judgment at all.


And
<em>Triptolemus</em>
and
<em>Phutatorius</em>
agreeing thereto, ask, How is it possible there should? for that wit and judgment in this world never go together; inasmuch as they are two operations differing from each other as wide as east is from west.


---So, says
<em>Locke,</em>
---so are farting and hickuping, say I.


<ps>
But in answer to this,
<em>Didius</em>
the great church lawyer, in his code
<em>de fartandi et illustrandi fallaciis,</em>
doth maintain and make fully appear, That an illustration is no argument, ---nor do I maintain the wiping of a looking-glass clean, to be a syllogism; ---but you all, may it please your worships,

<ps>to be great wits,---we should never agree amongst ourselves, one day to an end:---there would be so much satire and sarcasm,---scoffing and flouting, with raillying and reparteeing of it,--- thrusting and parrying in one corner or another,---there would be nothing but mischief amongst us. </ps>

---Chaste stars! what biting and scratching, and what a racket and a clatter we should make, what with breaking of heads, and rapping of knuckles, and hitting of sore places,--- there would be no such thing as living for us.

Now throughout this long tour which I have led you, you observe the good people are better off by far, than in the polar countries which we have just left: ---for if you hold your hand over your eyes, and look very attentively, your may perceive some small glimmerings (as it were) of wit, with a comfortable provision of good plain
<em>houshold</em>
judgment, which taking the quality and quantity of it together, they make a very good shift with,---and had they more of either the one or the other, it would destroy the proper ballance betwixt them, and I am satisfied moreover they would want occasions to put them to use.

Now, Sir, if I conduct you home again into this warmer and more luxuriant island, where you perceive the spring tide of our blood and humours runs high, ---where we have more ambition, and pride, and envy, and lechery, and other whoreson passions upon our hands to govern and subject to reason,---the
<em>height</em>
of our wit and the
<em>depth</em>
of our judgment, you see, are exactly proportioned to the
<em>length</em>
and
<em>breadth</em>
of our necessities,---and accordingly, we have them sent down amongst us in such a flowing kind of decent and creditable plenty, that no one thinks he has any cause to complain.

</p> 
<p>


<ps>It must however be confessed on this head, that, as our air blows hot and cold, ---wet and dry, ten times in a day, we have them in no regular and settled way; ---so that sometimes for near half a </ps>

</p> 
<p>

It is by these observations, and a wary reasoning by analogy in that kind of argumentative process, which
<em>Suidas</em>

Will you give me leave to illustrate this affair of wit and judgment, by the two knobs on the top of the back of it,--- they are fasten'd on, you see, with two pegs stuck slightly into two gimlet-holes, and will place what I have to say in so clear a light, as to let you see through the drift and meaning of my whole preface, as plainly as if every point and particle of it was made up of sun beams.

---Here stands
<em>wit,</em>
---and there stands
<em>judgment,</em>
close beside it, just like the two knobbs I'm speaking of, upon the back of this self same chair on which I am sitting.

---You see, they are the highest and most ornamental parts of its

---as wit and judgment are of
<em>ours,</em>
---and like them too, indubitably both made and fitted to go together, in order as we say in all such cases of duplicated embellishments, ---
<em>to answer one another</em>
.

</p>

---But did you ever see in the whole course of your lives such a ridiculous business as this has made of it? 
---Why, 'tis as miserable a sight as a sow with one ear; and there is just as much sense and symmetry in the one, as in the other:--- do,---pray, get off your seats, only to take a view of it. 

<ps>---Now would any man who valued his character a straw, have turned a piece of work out of his hand in such a condition?------nay, lay your hands upon your hearts, and answer this plain question, Whether this one single knobb which now stands here like a blockhead by itself, can serve any purpose upon earth, but to put one in mind of the want of the other;---and let me further ask, in case the chair was your own, if you would not in your consciences think, rather than be as it is, that </ps>

Now these two knobs---or top ornaments of the mind of man, which crown the whole entablature,---being, as I said, wit and judgment, which of all others, as I have proved it, are the most needful,--- the most priz'd,---the most calamitous to be without, and consequently the hardest to come at,---for all these reasons put together, there is not a mortal amongst us, so destitute of a love of good fame or feeding,------or so ignorant of what will do him good therein,---who does not wish and stedfastly resolve in his own mind, to be, or to be thought at least master of the one or the other, and indeed of both of them, if the thing seems any way feasible, or likely to be brought to pass.

Now your graver gentry having little or no kind of chance in aiming at the one,---unless they laid hold of the other, ---pray what do you think would become of them? 

---Why, Sirs, in spight of all their

they must e'en have been contented to have gone with their insides naked:---this was not to be borne, but by an effort of philosophy not to be supposed in the case we are upon,---so that no one could well have been angry with them, had they been satisfied with what little they could have snatched up and secreted under their cloaks and great perrywigs, had they not raised a

and

at the same time against the lawful owners.

<ps>outwitted by false sounds,---was nevertheless bubbled here. </ps>


The cry, it seems, was so deep and solemn a one, and what with the help of great wigs, grave faces, and other implements of deceit, was rendered so general a one against the
<em>poor wits</em>
in this matter, that the philosopher himself was deceived by it,---it was his glory to free the world from the lumber of a thousand vulgar errors;--- but this was not of the number; so that instead of sitting down cooly, as such a philosopher should have done, to have examined the matter of fact before he philosophised upon it;---on the contrary, he took the fact for granted, and so joined in with the cry, and halloo'd it as boisterously as the rest.

<strong>Every</strong>
day for at least ten years together did my father resolve to have it mended,---'tis not mended yet;--- no family but ours would have borne with it an hour,---and what is most astonishing, there was not a subject in the world upon which my father was so elegant, as upon that of door-hinges.

--- And yet at the same time, he was certainly one of the greatest bubbles to them, I think, that history can produce: his rhetoric and conduct were at perpetual handy-cuffs. 
---Never did the parlour-door open---but his philosophy or his principles fell a victim to it;---three drops of oyl with a feather, and a smart stroke of a hammer, had saved his honour for ever.

<p>
---Inconsistent soul that man is!--- languishing under wounds, which he has the power to heal!---his whole life a contradiction to his knowledge!---his reason, that precious gift of God to him---(instead of pouring in oyl) serving but to sharpen his sensibilities,---to multiply his pains and render him more melancholy and uneasy under them!---poor unhappy creature, that he should do so!---are not the necessary causes of misery in this life enow, but he must add voluntary ones to his stock of sorrow;---struggle against evils which cannot be avoided, and submit to others, which a tenth part of the trouble they create him, would remove from his heart for ever?

<strong>When</strong>
corporal
<em>Trim</em>
had brought his two mortars to bear, he was delighted with his handy-work above measure; and knowing what a pleasure it would be to his master to see them, he was not able to resist the desire he had of carrying them directly into his parlour.

</p> 
<p>

Now next to the moral lesson I had in view in mentioning the affair of
<em>hinges,</em>
I had a speculative consideration arising out of it, and it is this.

</p> 
<p>
Had the parlour-door open'd and turn'd upon its hinges, as a door should do------

<p>


<ps>
---Or for example, as cleverly as our government has been turning upon its hinges,---(that is, in case things have all along gone well with your worship,--- otherwise I give up my simile)---in this case, I say, there had been no danger either to master or man, in corporal
<em>Trim's</em>
peeping in: the moment, he had beheld my father and my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
fast asleep, ---the respectfulness of his carriage was such, he would have retired as silent as death, and left them both in their arm-chairs, dreaming as happy as he had found them: but the thing was morally speaking so very impracticable, that for the many years in which this hinge was suffered to be out of order, and amongst the hourly grievances my father submitted to upon its account,---this was one; that he never folded his arms to take his nap after dinner, but the thoughts of being

<p>

"
<em>When things move upon bad hinges,</em>
an' please your lordships,

?"

</p> 
<p>
Pray what's the matter? 
Who is there? cried my father, waking, the moment the door began to creak. 
---I wish the smith would give a peep at that confounded hinge. 

---'Tis nothing, an' please your honour, said
<em>Trim,</em>
but two mortars I am bringing in.

---They shan't make a clatter with them here, cried my father hastily.

---May it please your honour, cried
<em>Trim,</em>
---they are two mortar-pieces for a siege next summer, which I have been making out of a pair of jack-boots, which
<em>Obadiah</em>
told me your honour had left off wearing.


---By heaven! cried my father, springing out of his chair, as he swore,---I have not one appointment belonging to me, which I set so much store by, as I do by these jack-boots, ---they were our great-grandfather's, brother

replied my father, altering his tone, you care not what money you dissipate and throw away, provided, continued he, 'tis but upon a SIEGE.

<strong>All</strong>
is quiet and hush, cried my father, at least above stairs,---I hear not one foot stirring.


---Prithee,
<em>Trim,</em>
who is in the kitchen?


There is no one soul in the kitchen, answered
<em>Trim,</em>
making a low bow as he spoke, except Dr.
<em>Slop</em>
.

--- What can the fellow be puzzling about in the kitchen?

in making a bridge.

;---pray give my humble service to Dr.

and tell him I thank him heartily.

You must know, my uncle

there is nothing more dishonest in an historian, than the use of one,)---in order to conceive the probability of this error in my uncle

aright, I must give you some account of an adventure of

though much against my will.
</ps>


I say much against my will, only because the story, in one sense, is certainly out of its place here; for by right it should come in, either amongst the anecdotes of my uncle
<em>Toby's</em>
amours with widow
<em>Wadman,</em>
in which corporal
<em>Trim</em>
was no mean actor,---or else in the middle of his and my uncle

campaigns on the bowling green,---for it will do very well in either place;---but then if I reserve it for either of those parts of my story,---I ruin the story I'm upon,---and if I tell it here---I anticipate matters, and ruin it there.

<strong>Tho'</strong>
the shock my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
received the year after the demolition of
<em>Dunkirk,</em>
in his affair with widow
<em>Wadman,</em>
had fixed him in a resolution, never more to think of the sex,---or of aught which belonged to it;---yet corporal
<em>Trim</em>
had made no such bargain with himself.


<ps>
Indeed in my uncle
<em>Toby's</em>
case there was a strange and unaccountable concurrence of circumstances which insensibly

<ps>drew him in, to lay siege to that fair and strong citadel. </ps>


---In
<em>Trim's</em>
case there was a concurrence of nothing in the world, but of him and
<em>Bridget</em>
in the kitchen;---though in truth, the love and veneration he bore his master was such, and so fond was he of imitating him in all he did, that had my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
employed his time and genius in tagging of points,---I am persuaded the honest corporal would laid down his arms, and followed his example with pleasure.


When therefore my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
sat down before the mistress,---corporal
<em>Trim</em>
incontinently took ground before the maid.

<p>

Now, my dear friend
<em>Garrick,</em>

opificers of chit chat have ever since been working upon

pattern.

---I care not what
<em>Aristotle,</em>
or

or

say,--- (though I never read one of them)--- there is not a greater difference between a single-horse chair and madam
<em>Pompadour's vis</em>
a

than betwixt a single amour, and an amour thus nobly doubled, and going upon all four, prancing throughout a grand drama.

---Sir, a simple, single, silly affair of that kind,--- is quite lost in five acts,---but that is neither here or there. 
</p> 
<p>


<ps>
After a series of attacks and repulses in a course of nine months on my uncle
<em>Toby's</em>
quarter, a most minute account of every particular of which shall be given in its proper place, my uncle
<em>Toby,</em>
honest man! found it necessary to draw off

<ps>his forces, and raise the siege somewhat indignantly. </ps>


</p> 
<p>

Corporal
<em>Trim,</em>
as I said, had made no such bargain either with himself---or with any one else,---the fidelity however of his heart not suffering him to go into a house which his master had forsaken with disgust,---he contented himself with turning his part of the siege into a blockade; ---that is, he kept others off,--- for though he never after went to the house, yet he never met
<em>Bridget</em>
in the village, but he would either nod or wink, or smile, or look kindly at her,---or (as circumstances directed), he would shake her by the hand,---or ask her lovingly how she did,---or would give her a ribban, ---and now and then, though never but when it could be done with decorum, would give
<em>Bridget</em>

Precisely in this situation, did these things stand for five years; that is, from the demolition of
<em>Dunkirk</em>
in the year 13, to the latter end of my uncle
<em>Toby's</em>
campaign in the year 18, which was about six or seven weeks before the time I'm speaking of.


---When
<em>Trim,</em>
as his custom was, after he had put my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
to bed, going down one moon-shiny night to see that every thing was right at his fortifications, ---in the lane separated from the bowling-green with flowering shrubs and holly,---he espied his
<em>Bridget</em>
.

</p> 
<p>


<ps>
As the corporal thought there was nothing in the world so well worth shewing as the glorious works which he and my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
had made,
<em>Trim</em>
courteously and gallantly took her by the hand, and led her in: this was not done so privately, but that the foul-mouth'd trumpet of

Fame carried it from ear to ear, till at length it reached my father's, with this untoward circumstance along with it, that my uncle
<em>Toby's</em>
curious draw-bridge, constructed and painted after the
<em>Dutch</em>
fashion, and which went quite across the ditch,---was broke down, and some how or other crush'd all to pieces that very night.

My father, as you have observed, had no great esteem for my uncle
<em>Toby's</em>
hobby-horse,---he thought it the most ridiculous horse that ever gentleman mounted, and indeed unless my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
vexed him about it, could never think of it once, without smiling at it,---so that it never could get lame or happen any mischance, but it tickled my father's imagination beyond measure; but this being an accident much more to his humour

leap'd up without feeling the pain upon his groin,---and, with infinite pity, stood beside his brother's chair, tapping his back with one hand, and holding his head with the other, and from time to time, wiping his eyes with a clean cambrick handkerchief, which he pull'd out of his pocket.

<strong>The</strong>
draw-bridge being held irreparable,

was ordered directly to set about another,---but not upon the same model; for cardinal
<em>Alberoni's</em>
intrigues at that time being discovered, and my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
rightly foreseeing that a flame would inevitably break out betwixt
<em>Spain</em>
and the Empire, and that the operations of the ensuing campaign must in all likelihood be either in
<em>Naples</em>
or

---he determined upon an

uncle

took it of him in the field,--- convinced him, that if the King of
<em>Spain</em>
and the Emperor went together by the ears, that
<em>England</em>
and
<em>France</em>
and
<em>Holland</em>
must, by force of their pre-engagements, all enter the lifts too;---and if so, he would say, the combatants, brother
<em>Toby,</em>
as sure as we are alive, will fall to it again, pell-mell, upon the old prize-fighting stage of
<em>Flanders</em>
;---then what will you do with your
<em>Italian</em>
bridge?
</ps>


</p> 
<p>

---We will go on with it then, upon the old model, cried my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
.

</p> 
<p>

When corporal
<em>Trim</em>
had about half finished it in that stile,---my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
found out a capital defect in it, which he had never thoroughly considered before.


<ps>It turned, it seems, upon hinges at both ends of it, opening in the middle, one </ps>

<ps>
half of which turning to one side of the fosse, and the other, to the other; the advantage of which was this, that by dividing the weight of the bridge into two equal portions, it impowered my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
to raise it up or let it down with the end of his crutch, and with one hand, which, as his garrison was weak, was as much as he could well spare,---but the disadvantages of such a construction were insurmountable,---for by this means, he would say, I leave one half of my bridge in my enemy's possession,---and pray of what use is the other?
</ps>


</p> 
<p>
The natural remedy for this, was no doubt to have his bridge fast only at one end with hinges, so that the whole might be lifted up together, and stand bolt upright, ---but that was rejected for the reason given above. 
</p>

For a whole week after he was determined in his mind to have one of that particular construction which is made to draw back horizontally, to hinder a passage; and to thrust forwards again to gain a passage,---of which sorts your worships might have seen three famous ones at
<em>Spires</em>
before its destruction,---and one now at
<em>Brisac,</em>
if I mistake not;--- but my father advising my uncle
<em>Toby,</em>
with great earnestness, to have nothing more to do with thrusting bridges,---and my uncle foreseeing moreover that it would but perpetuate the memory of the corporal's misfortune,---he changed his mind, for that of the marquis
<em>d'H&ocirc;pital's</em>
invention, which the younger

has so well and learnedly described, as your worships may see,---

My uncle

understood the nature of a parabola as well as any man in

---but was not quite such a master of the cycloid;---he talked however about it every day;---the bridge went not forwards.

father's collection was not great, but to make amends, it was curious; and consequently, he was some time in making it; he had the great good fortune however to set off well, in getting
<em>Bruscambille's</em>
prologue upon long noses, almost for nothing,---for he gave no more for

than three half crowns; owing indeed to the strong fancy which the stall-man saw my father had for the book the moment he laid his hands upon it.

</p> 
<p>

The doctrine, you see, was laid down by
<em>Erasmus,</em>
as my father wished it, with the utmost plainness; but my father's disappointment was, in finding nothing more from so able a pen, but the bare fact itself; without any of that speculative subtilty or ambidexterity of argumentation upon it, which heaven had bestow'd upon man on purpose to investigate truth and fight for her on all sides.

<ps>it over and over again with great application, studying every word and every syllable of it thro' and thro' in its most strict and literal interpretation,---he could still make nothing of it, that way. </ps>

Mayhaps there is more meant, than is said in it, quoth my father. 

---Learned men, brother

don't write dialogues upon long noses for nothing.

------I'll study the mystic and the allegoric sense,------here is some room to turn a man's self in, brother.

My father read on.------ 
</p> 
<p>

Now, I find it needful to inform your reverences and worships, that besides the many nautical uses of long noses enumerated by
<em>Erasmus,</em>
the dialogist affirmeth that a long nose is not without its domestic conveniences also, for that in a case of distress,---and for want of a pair of bellows, it will do excellently well,
<em>ad excitandum focum,</em>
(to stir up the fire.)

Nature had been prodigal in her gifts to my father beyond measure, and had sown the seeds of verbal criticism as deep within him, as she had done the seeds of all other knowledge,---so that he had got out his penknife, and was trying experiments upon the sentence, to see if he could not scratch some better sense into it. 

---I've got within a single letter, brother

cried my father, of

his mystic meaning.

---You are near enough, brother, replied my uncle, in all conscience.

For this cause it is, that I forbear to speak of so many (otherwise) valuable books and treatises of my father's collecting, wrote either, plump upon noses,--- or collaterally touching them;---such for instance as

the mensuration and configuration of the osseous or boney parts of human noses, in any

where they are all crush'd down by the thumb, so that no judgment can be formed upon them,---are much nearer alike, than the world imagines;---the difference amongst them, being, he says, a mere trifle, not worth taking notice of, ---but that the size and jollity of every individual nose, and by which one nose ranks above another, and bears a higher price, is owing to the cartilagenous and muscular parts of it, into whose ducts and sinuses the blood and animal spirits being impell'd, and driven by the warmth and force of the imagination, which is but a step from it, (bating the case of ideots, whom

happens, and ever must, says

that the excellency of the nose is in a direct arithmetical proportion to the excellency of the wearer's fancy.

</p> 
<p>

It is for the same reason, that is, because 'tis all comprehended in

that I say nothing likewise of
<em>Scroderus (Andrea)</em>
who all the world knows, set himself to oppugn
<em>Prignitz</em>
with great violence,---proving it in his own way, first,

and then by a series of stubborn facts, "That so far was
<em>Prignitz</em>
from the truth, in affirming that the fancy begat the nose, that on the contrary,---the nose begat the fancy."

</p> 
<p>


<ps>
---The learned suspected

of an indecent sophism in this,---and

cried out aloud in the dispute, that

had shifted the idea upon him,

---but
<em>Scroderus</em>
went on, maintaining his thesis.---
</ps>


</p> 
<p>

My father was just balancing within himself, which of the two sides he should take in this affair; when
<em>Ambrose Par&aelig;us</em>
decided it in a moment, and by overthrowing the systems, both of
<em>Prignitz</em>
and
<em>Scroderus,</em>
drove my father out of both sides of the controversy at once.

noses, and his manner of setting them on,---was esteemed by the whole college of physicians at that time, as more knowing in matters of noses, than any one who had ever taken them in hand.
</ps>


</p> 
<p>


<ps>
Now
<em>Ambrose Par&aelig;us</em>
convinced my father, that the true and efficient cause of what had engaged so much the attention of the world, and upon which
<em>Prignitz</em>
and
<em>Scroderus</em>
had wasted so much learning and fine parts,---was neither this nor that,---but that the length and goodness of the nose was owing simply to the softness and flaccidity in the nurse's breast, ---as the flatness and shortness of
<em>puisne</em>
noses was, to the firmness and elastic repulsion of the same organ of nutrition

;---but that in case of the flaccidity and softness of the nurse or mother's breast,---by sinking into it, quoth
<em>Par&aelig;us,</em>
as into so much butter, the nose was comforted, nourish'd, plump'd up, refresh'd, refocillated, and set a growing for ever.
</ps>


</p> 
<p>

I have but two things to observe of

; first, that he proves and explains all this with the utmost chastity and decorum of expression:---for which may his soul for ever rest in peace!

'Twas some misfortune, I make no doubt, in this affair, that my father had every word of it to translate for the benefit of my uncle

and render out of
<em>Slawkenbergius's Latin,</em>
of which, as he was no great master, his translation was not always of the purest,---and generally least so where 'twas most wanted,---this naturally open'd a door to a second misfortune; ---that in the warmer paroxisms of his zeal to open my uncle

eyes ---my father's ideas run on, as much faster than the translation, as the translation outmoved my uncle

<strong>The</strong>
gift of ratiocination and making syllogisms,---I mean in man, ---for in superior classes of beings, such as angels and spirits,---'tis all done, may it please your worships, as they tell me, by INTUITION;---and beings inferior, as your worships all know,------syllogize by their noses: though there is an island swiming in the sea, though not altogether at its ease, whose inhabitants, if my intelligence deceives me not, are so wonderfully gifted, as to syllogize after the same fashion, and oft-times to make very well out too:---but that's neither here nor there---

<ps>
act of ratiocination in man, as logicians tell us, is the finding out the agreement or disagreement of two ideas one with another, by the intervention of a third; (called the
<em>medius terminus</em>
) just as a man, as
<em>Locke</em>
well observes, by a yard, finds two mens nine-pin-alleys to be of the same length, which could not be brought together, to measure their equality, by

.

Had the same great reasoner looked on, as my father illustrated his systems of noses, and observed my uncle

deportment, ---what great attention he gave to every word,---and as oft as he took his pipe from his mouth, with what wonderful seriousness he contemplated the length of it,---surveying it transversely as he held it betwixt his finger and his thumb, ---then foreright,---then this way, and

had got hold of the

; and was syllogizing and measuring with it the truth of each hypothesis of long noses, in order as my father laid them before him.
</ps>


This by the bye, was more than my father wanted,--- his aim in all the pains he was at in these philosophic lectures,---was to enable my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
not to
<em>discuss,</em>
---but
<em>comprehend</em>
---to
<em>hold</em>
the grains and scruples of learning,---not to

them.

<strong>'Tis</strong>
a pity, cried my father one winter's night, after a three hours painful translation of
<em>Slawkenbergius,</em>
---'tis a pity, cried my father, putting my mother's thread-paper into the book for a mark, as he spoke------that truth, brother
<em>Toby,</em>
should shut herself up in such impregnable fastnesses, and be so obstinate as not to surrender herself sometimes up upon the closest siege.---

</p> 
<p>


<ps>
Now it happened then, as indeed it had often done before, that my uncle
<em>Toby's</em>
fancy, during the time of my father's explanation of
<em>Prignitz</em>
to him,---having nothing to stay it there, had taken a short flight to the bowling-green;---his body might as well have taken a turn there

too,---so that with all the semblance of a deep school-man intent upon the

---my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
was in fact as ignorant of the whole lecture, and all its pro's and con's, as if my father had been translating

tongue into the

But the word
<em>siege,</em>
like a talismanic power,' in my father's metaphor, wafting back my uncle
<em>Toby's</em>
fancy, quick as a note could follow the touch,---he open'd his ears,---and my father observing that he took his pipe out of his mouth, and shuffled his chair nearer the table, as with a desire to profit,---my father with great pleasure began his sentence again,--- changing only the plan, and dropping the metaphor of the siege of it, to keep clear of some dangers my father apprehended from it.

'Twas well my father's passions lasted not long; for so long as they did last, they led him a busy life on't, and it is one of the most unaccountable problems that ever I met with in my observations of human nature, that nothing should prove my father's mettle so much, or make his passions go off so like gun-powder, as the unexpected strokes his science met with from the quaint simplicity of my uncle

---He was five minutes and thirty-five seconds about it in the present case.

By all that's good! said my father, swearing, as he came to himself, and taking the oath out of

--- why one man's nose is longer than another's, but because that God pleases to have it so.

only left,---there would be enough in him in all conscience, he would say, to set the world a going again.
</ps>



<ps>
A treasure therefore was he indeed! an institute of all that was necessary to be known of noses, and every thing else,---at
<em>matin,</em>
noon, and vespers was
<em>Hafen Slawkenbergius</em>
his recreation and delight: 'twas for ever in his hands,---you would have sworn, Sir, it had been a canon's prayer-book, ---so worn, so glazed, so contrited

<br>

<ps>and attrited was it with fingers and with thumbs in all its parts, from one end even unto the other. </ps>


</p> 
<p>

I am not such a bigot to
<em>Slawkenbergius,</em>
as my father;---there is a fund in him, no doubt; but in my opinion, the best, I don't say the most profitable, but the most amusing part of
<em>Hafen Slawkenbergius,</em>
is his tales,---and, considering he was a
<em>German,</em>
many of them told not without fancy:---these take up his second book, containing nearly one half of his folio, and are comprehended in ten decads, each decad containing ten tales.


<ps>
------Philosophy is not built upon tales; and therefore 'twas certainly wrong in
<em>Slawkenbergius</em>
to send them into the world by that name;---there are a few of them in his eight, ninth, and tenth decads, which I own seem rather playful and sportive, than speculative,---but in general

<br>

<ps>they are to be looked upon by the learned as a detail of so many independent facts, all of them turning round somehow or other upon the main hinges of his subject, and collected by him with great fidelity, and added to his work as so many illustrations upon the doctrines of noses. </ps>


</p> 
<p>
As we have leisure enough upon our hands,---if you give me leave, madam, I'll tell you the ninth tale of his tenth decad.

SLAWKENBERGIUS's
<strong>Tale</strong>
.
</center>
</h4>
<br>

<p>


<strong>It</strong>
was one cool refreshing evening, at the close of a very sultry day, in the latter end of the month of
<em>August,</em>
when a stranger, mounted upon a dark mule, with a small cloak-bag behind him, containing a few shirts, a pair of shoes, and a crimson-sattin pair of breeches, entred the town of
<em>Strasburg</em>
.

</p> 
<p>

He told the centinel, who questioned him as he entered the gates, that he had been at the promontory of
<strong>Noses</strong>
---was going on to
<em>Frankfort</em>
---and should be back again at
<em>Strasburg</em>
that day month, in his way to the borders of
<em>Crim-Tartary</em>
.

</p>

<br>

<p>
The centinel looked up into the stranger's face---never saw such a nose in his life! 
</p> 
<p>
---I have made a very good venture of it, quoth the stranger---so slipping his wrist out of the loop of a black ribban, to which a short scymetar was hung: 
He put his hand into his pocket, and with great courtesy touching the forepart of his cap with his left-hand, as he extended his right---he put a florin into the centinel's hand, and passed on. 
</p> 
<p>


<ps>It grieves me, said the centinel, speaking to a little dwarfish bandy-leg'd drummer, that so courteous a soul should have lost his scabbard---he cannot travel without one to his scymetar, and will not be able to get a scabbard to fit it in all </ps>

<ps>

<em>Strasburg</em>
.
</ps>

---I never had one, replied the stranger, looking back to the centinel, and putting his hand up to his cap as he spoke---I carry it, continued he thus---holding up his naked scymetar, his mule moving on slowly all the time, on purpose to defend my nose. 
</p> 
<p>
It is well worth it, gentle stranger, replied the centinel. 
</p> 
<p>
---'Tis not worth a single stiver, said the bandy-leg'd drummer---'tis a nose of parchment. 
</p> 
<p>
As I am a true catholic---except that it is six times as big---'tis a nose, said the centinel, like my own. 
</p> 
<p>
---I heard it crackle, said the drummer.

<br>

<p>
By dunder, said the centinel, I saw it bleed. 
</p> 
<p>
What a pity, cried the bandy-legg'd drummer, we did not both touch it! 
</p> 
<p>
At the very time that this dispute was maintaining by the centinel and the drummer---was the same point debating betwixt a trumpeter and a trumpeter's wife, who were just then coming up, and had stopped to see the stranger pass by. 
</p> 
<p>


<em>Benedicity!</em>

---What a nose! 'tis as long, said the trumpeter's wife, as a trumpet. 
</p> 
<p>
And of the same mettle, said the trumpeter, as you hear by its sneezing. 
</p>

---'Tis a soft as a flute, said she. 
</p> 
<p>
---'Tis brass, said the trumpeter. 
</p> 
<p>
---'Tis a pudding's end---said his wife. 
</p> 
<p>
I tell thee again, said the trumpeter, 'tis a brazen nose. 
</p> 
<p>
I'll know the bottom of it, said the trumpeter's wife, for I will touch it with my finger before I sleep. 
</p> 
<p>
The stranger's mule moved on at so slow a rate, that he heard every word of the dispute, not only betwixt the centinel and the drummer; but betwixt the trumpeter and the trumpeter's wife. 
</p> 
<p>


<ps>No! said he, dropping his reins upon his mule's neck, and laying both his </ps>

<ps>hands upon his breast, the one over the other in a saint-like position (his mule going on easily all the time) No! said he, looking up,---I am not such a debtor to the world---slandered and disappointed as I have been------as to give it that conviction---no! said he, my nose shall never be touched whilst heaven gives me strength---To do what? said a burgomaster's wife. </ps>


</p> 
<p>


<ps>
The stranger took no notice of the burgomaster's wife---he was making a vow to saint
<em>Nicolas</em>
; which done, having uncrossed his arms with the same solemnity with which he crossed them, he took up the reins of his bridle with his left-hand, and putting his right-hand into his bosom, with his scymetar hanging loosely to the wrist of it, he rode on as slowly as one foot of the mule could follow

another thro' the principal streets of
<em>Strasburg,</em>
till chance brought him to the great inn in the market-place over-against the church.
</ps>


</p> 
<p>
The moment the stranger alighted, he ordered his mule to be led into the stable, and his cloak-bag to be brought in; then opening, and taking out of it, his crimson-sattin breeches, with a silver-fringed ---(appendage to them, which I dare not translate)---he put his breeches, with his fringed cod-piece on, and forthwith with his short scymetar in his hand, walked out to the grand parade. 
</p> 
<p>


<ps>The stranger had just taken three turns upon the parade, when he perceived the trumpeter's wife at the opposite side of it---so turning short, in pain lest his nose should be attempted, he instantly went </ps>

I am going forwards, said the stranger, for

------and shall be back at

this day month.

<p>
I hope, continued the stranger, stroking down the face of his mule with his left-hand as he was going to mount it, that you have been kind to this faithful slave of mine------it has carried me and my cloak-bag, continued he, tapping the mule's back, above six hundred leagues.

<p>

Whilst the stranger was giving this odd account of himself, the master of the inn and his wife kept both their eyes fixed full upon the stranger's nose--- By saint
<em>Radagunda,</em>
said the inn-keeper's wife to herself, there is more of it than in any dozen of the largest noses put together in all
<em>Strasburg</em>
! is it not, said she, whispering her husband in his ear, is it not a noble nose?

</p> 
<p>
'Tis an imposture, my dear, said the master of the inn---'tis a false nose.--- 
</p> 
<p>
'Tis a true nose, said his wife.---

'Tis made of fir-tree, said he,---I smell the turpentine.---

I have made a vow to saint

this day, said the stranger, that my nose shall not be touched till---Here the stranger, suspending his voice, looked up--- Till when? said she hastily.

</p> 
<p>
It never shall be touched, said he, clasping his hands and bringing them close to his breast, till that hour. 
--- What hour? cried the inn-keeper's wife. 
------Never!---never! said the stranger, never tell I am got---For heaven sake into what place? said she.

The stranger had not got half a league on his way towards
<em>Frankfort,</em>
before all the city of
<em>Strasburg</em>
was in an uproar about his nose.


The
<em>Compline</em>
-bells were just ringing to call the
<em>Strasburgers</em>
to their devotions, and shut up the duties of the day in prayer:------no soul in all
<em>Strasburg</em>
heard 'em---the city was like a swarm of bees------men, women, and children (the
<em>Compline</em>
-bells tinkling all the time) flying here and there---in at one door, out at another---this way and that way---long ways and cross ways--- up one street, down another street---in at this ally, out at that---did you see it? did you see it? did you see it?

O! did you see it?---who saw it? who did see it? for mercy's sake, who saw it?

Whilst all this confusion and disorder triumphed throughout the great city of

was the courteous stranger going on as gently upon his mule in his way to

as if he had had no concern at all in the affair---talking all the way he rode in broken sentences, sometimes to his mule---sometimes to himself--- sometimes to his Julia.

They amicably laid it down, that there was a just and geometrical arrangement and proportion of the several parts of the human frame to its several destinations, offices, and functions, which could not be transgressed but within certain limits ---that nature, though she sported---she sported within a certain circle;---and they could not agree about the diameter of it.

The only objection to this was, that if it proved any thing, it proved the stranger's nose was neither true nor false.

This left room for the controversy to go on. 

It was maintained by the advocates of the ecclesiastic court, that there was nothing to inhibit a decree, since the stranger

had confessed he had been at the Promontory of Noses, and had got one of the goodliest,

The two universities of

The Protestant doctors had demonstrated, that he had not sailed right before the wind, as the Popish doctors had pretended; and as every one knew there was no sailing full in the teeth of it,---they were going to settle, in case he had sailed, how many points he was off; whether
<em>Martin</em>
had doubled the cape, or had fallen upon a lee-shore; and no doubt, as it was an enquiry of much edification, at least to those who understood this sort of NAVIGATION, they had gone on with it in spite of the size of the stranger's nose, had not the size of the stranger's

'Twas a square cap with a silk tassel upon the crown of it---to a nut shell--- to have guessed on which side of the nose the two universities would split.

By God in heaven, cried the Popish doctors, he can make a nose, if he thinks fit, as big as the steeple of

Now the steeple of

being the biggest and the tallest church-steeple to be seen in the whole world, the Antinosarians denied that a nose of 575 geometrical feet in length could be worn, at least by a middle-siz'd man---The Popish doctors swore it could---The

doctors said No;---it could not.

but rejoiceth moreover in all the essential and integrant parts of it--- it has its

the
<em>Catastasis,</em>
and which usually takes up the 2d and 3d act, is included within that busy period of my tale, betwixt the first night's uproar about the nose, to the conclusion of the trumpeter's wife's lectures upon it in the middle of the grand parade; and from the first embarking of the learned in the dispute--- to the doctors finally sailing away, and leaving the

The traveller was the brother of the Julia, so often invoked that night by the stranger as he rode from

upon his mule; and was come, on her part, in quest of him.


He had accompanied his sister from

across the

mountains thro'

The lines were very natural---for they were nothing at all to the purpose, says
<em>Slawkenbergius,</em>
and 'tis a pity there were no more of them; but whether it was that Seig.
<em>Diego</em>
was slow in composing verses---or the ostler quick in saddling mules---is not averred; certain it was, that
<em>Diego's</em>
mule and
<em>Fernandez's</em>
horse were ready at the door of the inn, before
<em>Diego</em>
was ready for his second stanza; so without staying to finish his ode, they both mounted, sallied forth, passed the
<em>Rhine,</em>
traversed
<em>Alsace,</em>
shaped their course towards
<em>Lyons,</em>
and before the
<em>Strasburgers</em>
and the abbess of
<em>Quedlinberg</em>
had set out on their cavalcade, had
<em>Fernandez, Diego,</em>
and his
<em>Julia,</em>
crossed the
<em>Pyrenean</em>
mountains, and got safe to
<em>Valadolid</em>
.

<p>

'Tis needless to inform the geographical reader, that when
<em>Diego</em>
was in
<em>Spain,</em>
it was not possible to meet the courteous stranger in the
<em>Frankfort</em>
road; it is enough to say, that of all restless desires, curiosity being the strongest---the
<em>Strasburgers</em>
felt the full force of it; and that for three days and nights they were tossed to and fro in the
<em>Frankfort</em>
road, with the tempestuous fury of this passion, before they could submit to return home--- When alas! an event was prepared for them, of all others the most grievous that could befal a free people.

</p> 
<p>

As this revolution of the
<em>Strasburgers</em>
affairs is often spoken of, and little understood, I will, in ten words, says
<em>Slawkenbergius,</em>
give the world an explanation of it, and with it put an end to my tale.

<p>

Every body knows of the grand system of Universal Monarchy, wrote by order of Mons.
<em>Colbert,</em>
and put in manuscript into the hands of
<em>Lewis</em>
the fourteenth, in the year 1664.

</p> 
<p>

'Tis as well known, that one branch out of many of that system, was the getting possession of
<em>Strasburg,</em>
to favour an entrance at all times into
<em>Suabia,</em>
in order to disturb the quiet of
<em>Germany</em>
--- and that in consequence of this plan,
<em>Strasburg</em>
unhappily fell at length into their hands.

</p> 
<p>
It is the lot of few to trace out the true springs of this and such like revolutions ---The vulgar look too high for them---Statesmen look too low---Truth (for once) lies in the middle.

<p>

What a fatal thing is the popular pride of a free city! cries one historian---The
<em>Strasburgers</em>
deemed it a diminution of their freedom to receive an imperial garrison ---and so fell a prey to a
<em>French</em>
one.

</p> 
<p>

The fate, says another, of the
<em>Strasburgers,</em>
may be a warning to all free people to save their money---They anticipated their revenues---brought themselves under taxes, exhausted their strength, and in the end became so weak a people, they had not strength to keep their gates shut, and so the
<em>French</em>
pushed them open.

</p> 
<p>


<ps>
Alas! alas! cries
<em>Slawkenbergius,</em>
'twas not the
<em>French</em>
---'twas CURIOSITY pushed them open---The
<em>French</em>
indeed, who are ever upon the catch, when they saw the
<em>Strasburgers,</em>
men, women, and children,

<ps>all marched out to follow the stranger's nose---each man followed his own, and marched in. </ps>


</p> 
<p>

Trade and manufactures have decayed and gradually grown down ever since--- but not from any cause which commercial heads have assigned; for it is owing to this only, that Noses have ever so run in their heads, that the
<em>Strasburgers</em>
could not follow their business.

</p> 
<p>

Alas! alas! cries
<em>Slawkenbergius,</em>
making an exclamation---it is not the first--- and I fear will not be the last fortress that has been either won---or lost by
<strong>Noses</strong>

<strong>My</strong>

---That's another concern, said my father testily--- But I say,
<em>Toby,</em>
when one runs over the catalogue of all the cross reckonings and sorrowful
<em>items</em>
with which the heart of man is overcharged, 'tis wonderful by what hidden resources the mind is enabled to stand it out, and bear itself up, as it does against the impositions laid upon our nature.

---'Tis by the assistance of Almighty God, cried my uncle

looking up, and pressing the palms of his hands close together---'tis not from our own strength, brother

---That is cutting the knot, said my father, instead of untying it.

With all my heart, replied my uncle

My father instantly exchanged the attitude he was in, for that in which
<em>Socrates</em>
is so finely painted by
<em>Raffael</em>
in his school of
<em>Athens</em>
; which your connoisseurship knows is so exquisitely imagined, that even the particular manner of the reasoning of

was saying to the libertine he is reclaiming ---"
<em>You grant me</em>
this---and this: and this, and this, I don't ask of you---they follow of themselves in course."
</ps>


</p> 
<p>

So stood my father, holding fast his fore-finger betwixt his finger and his thumb, and reasoning with my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
as he sat in his old fringed chair, valanced around with party-coloured worsted bobs---O
<em>Garrick</em>
! what a rich scene of this would thy exquisite powers make! and how gladly would I write such another to avail myself of thy immortality, and secure my own behind it.

<strong>Is</strong>
it not a shame to make two chapters of what passed in going down one pair of stairs? for we are got no farther yet than to the first landing, and there are fifteen more steps down to the bottom; and for aught I know, as my father and my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
are in a talking humour, there may be as many chapters as steps;---let that be as it will, Sir, I can no more help it than my destiny:

Now this, you must know, being my chapter upon chapters, which I promised to write before I went to sleep, I thought it meet to ease my conscience entirely before I lay'd down, by telling the world all I knew about the matter at once: 

<ps>Is not this ten times better than to set out dogmatically with a sententious parade of wisdom, and telling the world a story of a roasted horse---that chapters relieve the mind---that they assist---or impose upon the imagination---and that in a work of this dramatic cast they are as necessary as </ps>

I'll get up---There is no time, cried
<em>Susannah,</em>
the child's as black as my shoe.


<em>Trismegistus,</em>
said my father---But stay ---thou art a leaky vessel,
<em>Susannah,</em>
added my father; canst thou carry
<em>Trismegistus</em>
in thy head, the length of the gallery without scattering---Can I? cried
<em>Susannah,</em>
shutting the door in a huff--- If she can, I'll be shot, said my father, bouncing out of bed in the dark, and groping for his breeches.

</p> 
<p>


<em>Susannah</em>
ran with all speed along the gallery.

</p> 
<p>
My father made all possible speed to find his breeches. 
</p>

<em>Susannah</em>
got the start, and kept it--- 'Tis

My father followed
<em>Susannah</em>
with his night-gown across his arm, with nothing more than his breeches on, fastened through haste with but a single button, and that button through haste thrust only half into the button-hole.

As well, said

as can be expected ---Pish! said my father, the button of his breeches slipping out of the button-hole ---So that whether the interjection was levelled at
<em>Susannah,</em>
or the button-hole, ---whether pish was an interjection of contempt or an interjection of modesty, is a doubt, and must be a doubt till I shall have time to write the three following favorite chapters, that is, my chapter of

---my chapter of
<em>pishes,</em>
and my chapter of
<em>button-holes</em>

<strong>I</strong>
Wish I could write a chapter upon sleep.

</p> 
<p>
A fitter occasion could never have presented itself, than what this moment offers, when all the curtains of the family are drawn---the candles put out---and no creature's eyes are open but a single one, for the other has been shut these twenty years, of my mother's nurse.

<p>
And yet, as fine as it is, I would undertake to write a dozen chapters upon button-holes, both quicker and with more fame than a single chapter upon this. 
</p> 
<p>
Button-holes!---there is something lively in the very idea of 'em---and trust me, when I get amongst 'em---You gentry with great beards---look as grave as you will---I'll make merry work with my button-holes---I shall have 'em all to myself---'tis a maiden subject ---I shall run foul of no man's wisdom or fine sayings in it. 
</p>

The world enjoys other pleasures, says he, as they do that of sleep, without tasting or feeling it as it slips and passes by---We should study and ruminate upon it, in order to render proper thanks to him who grants it to us---for this end I cause myself to be disturbed in my sleep, that I may the better and more sensibly relish it---And yet I see few, says he again, who live with less sleep when need requires; my body is capable of a firm, but not of a violent and sudden agitation---I evade of late all violent exercises---I am never weary with walking ---but from my youth, I never liked to ride upon pavements.

I love to lie hard and alone, and even without my wife---This last word may stagger the faith of the world---but remember, "La Vraisemblance (as

<strong>When</strong>
the misfortune of my NOSE fell so heavily upon my father's head,---the reader remembers that he walked instantly up stairs, and cast himself down upon his bed; and from hence, unless he has a great insight into human nature, he will be apt to expect a rotation of the same ascending and descending movements from him, upon this misfortune of my NAME;--- no.

</p> 
<p>
The different weight, dear Sir,---nay even the different package of two vexations of the same weight,---makes a very wide difference in our manners of bearing and getting through with them. 

<ps>---It is </ps>

<br>

<ps>not half an hour ago, when (in the great hurry and precipitation of a poor devil's writing for daily bread) I threw a fair sheet, which I had just finished, and carefully wrote out, slap into the fire, instead of the foul one. </ps>


</p> 
<p>

Instantly I snatch'd off my wig, and threw it perpendicularly, with all imaginable violence, up to the top of the room ---indeed I caught it as it fell---but there was an end of the matter; nor do I think any thing else in
<em>Nature,</em>
would have given such immediate ease:


<ps>
She, dear Goddess, by an instantaneous impulse, in all

determines us to a sally of this or that member---or else she thrusts us into this or that place, or posture of body, we know not why--- But mark, madam, we live amongst riddles and mysteries---the most obvious

<br>

<ps>things, which come in our way, have dark sides, which the quickest sight cannot penetrate into; and even the clearest and most exalted understandings amongst us find ourselves puzzled and at a loss in almost every cranny of nature's works; so that this, like a thousand other things, falls out for us in a way, which tho' we cannot reason upon it,---yet we find the good of it, may it please your reverences and your worships---and that's enough for us. </ps>


</p> 
<p>
Now, my father could not lie down with this affliction for his life---nor could he carry it up stairs like the other---He walked composedly out with it to the fish-pond.

way to have gone---reason, with all her force, could not have directed him to any thing like it: there is something, Sir, in fish-ponds---but what it is, I leave to system builders and fish pond diggers betwixt 'em to find out---but there is something, under the first disorderly transport of the humours, so unaccountably becalming in an orderly and a sober walk towards one of them, that I have often wondered that neither
<em>Pythagoras,</em>
nor
<em>Plato,</em>
nor
<em>Solon,</em>
nor
<em>Licurgus,</em>
nor
<em>Mahomet,</em>
nor any of your noted law-givers, ever gave order about them.

---What evils since!---produced into being, in the decline of thy father's days---when the powers of his imagination and of his body were waxing feeble--- when radical heat and radical moisture, the elements which should have temper'd thine, were drying up; and nothing left to found thy stamina in, but negations--- ---'tis pitiful---brother

at the best, and called out for all the little helps that care and attention on both sides could give it.

But how were we defeated! 

You know the event, brother
<em>Toby,</em>
---'tis too melancholy a one to be repeated now,---when the few animal spirits I was worth in the world, and with which memory, fancy, and quick parts should have been convey'd,---were all dispersed, confused, confounded, scattered, and sent to the devil.---

Here then was the time to have put a stop to this persecution against him;--- and tried an experiment at least---whether calmness and serenity of mind in your sister, with a due attention, brother
<em>Toby,</em>
to her evacuations and repletions---and the rest of her non-naturals, might not, in a course of nine months gestation, have set all things to rights.

---My child was bereft of these! 
---What a teazing life did she lead herself, and consequently her foetus too, with that nonsensical anxiety of hers about lying in in town? 

<ps>
I thought my sister submitted with the greatest patience, replied my uncle
<em>Toby</em>

But what was all this, my dear
<em>Toby,</em>
to the injuries done us by my child's coming head foremost into the world, when all I wished in this general wreck of his frame, was to have saved this little casket unbroke, unrifled---

</p> 
<p>

With all my precautions, how was my system turned topside turvy in the womb with my child! his head exposed to the hand of violence, and a pressure of 470 pounds averdupois weight acting so perpendicularly upon its apex---that at this hour 'tis ninety

<ps>enough of it---So there's an end of that matter. </ps>


</p> 
<p>

But before I begin my demonstration, let me only tell you, that the chapter which I have torn out, and which otherwise you would all have been reading just now, instead of this,---was the description of my father's, my uncle

all his works with the left-hand, like
<em>Turpilius</em>
the
<em>Roman,</em>
or
<em>Hans Holbein</em>
of
<em>Basil</em>
---or whether 'twas more from the blunder of his head than hand---or whether, lastly, it was from the sinister turn, which every thing relating to our family was apt to take---It so fell out, however, to our reproach, that instead of the
<em>bend dexter,</em>
which since
<em>Harry</em>
the Eighth's reign was honestly our due---a
<em>bend sinister,</em>
by some of these fatalities, had been drawn quite across the field of the

</ps>

'Tis scarce credible that the mind of so wise a man as my father was, could be so much incommoded with so small a matter. 

<ps>The word coach---let it be whose it would---or coach-man, or coach-horse, or coach-hire, could never be named in the family, but he constantly complained of carrying this vile mark of Illegitimacy upon the door of his own; </ps>

he never once was able to step into the coach, or out of it, without turning round to take a view of the arms, and making a vow at the same time, that it was the last time he would ever set his foot in it again, till the
<em>bend-sinister</em>
was taken out---but like the affair of the hinge, it was one of the many things which the
<em>Destinies</em>
had set down in their books---ever to be grumbled at (and in wiser families than ours)---but never to be mended.
</ps>

---Has the

<em>Obadiah,</em>
but the lining.

<em>Dinah</em>
to a visitation with a

if you think fit---My poor uncle
<em>Toby</em>
blush'd.
</ps>


My father was vexed at himself---No---my dear brother
<em>Toby,</em>
said my father, changing his tone---but the damp of the coach-lining about my loins, may give me the Sciatica again, as it did
<em>December, January,</em>
and
<em>February</em>
last winter---so if you please you shall ride my wife's pad ---and as you are to preach,

upon this occasion,---that I declare,
<em>Didius,</em>
I would suffer martyrdom ---and if it was possible my horse with me, a thousand times over, before I would sit down and make such another:

I was delivered of it at the wrong end of me---it came from my head instead of my heart---and it is for the pain it gave me, both in the writing and preaching of it, that I revenge myself of it, in this manner. 

<ps>---To preach, to shew the extent of our reading, or the subtleties of our wit---to parade it in the eyes of the vulgar with the beggarly accounts of a little learning, tinseled over with a few words which glitter, but convey little light and less warmth---is a dishonest use of the poor single half hour in a week which is put into our hands---'Tis not preaching </ps>

<strong>Zounds</strong>
! --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- Z---ds! cried
<em>Phutatorius,</em>
partly to himself---and yet high enough to be heard---and what seemed odd, 'twas uttered in a construction of look, and in a tone of voice, somewhat between that of a man in amazement, and of one in bodily pain.

</p> 
<p>


<ps>
One or two who had very nice ears, and could distinguish the expression and mixture of the two tones as plainly as a
<em>third</em>
or a

or any other chord in musick---were the most puzzled and perplexed with it---the

was good in itself---but then 'twas quite out of the

<ps>key, and no way applicable to the subject started;---so that with all their knowledge, they could not tell what in the world to make of it. </ps>


</p> 
<p>

Others who knew nothing of musical expression, and merely lent their ears to the plain import of the
<em>word,</em>
imagined that
<em>Phutatorius,</em>
who was somewhat of a cholerick spirit, was just going to snatch the cudgels out of
<em>Didius's</em>
hands, in order to bemawl
<em>Yorick</em>
to some purpose---and that the desperate monosyllable Z---ds was the exordium to an oration, which, as they judged from the sample, presaged but a rough kind of handling of him; so that my uncle
<em>Toby's</em>
good nature felt a pang for what
<em>Yorick</em>
was about to undergo.


<ps>
But seeing
<em>Phutatorius</em>
stop short, without any attempt or desire to go on---a third party began to suppose,

<ps>that it was no more than an involuntary respiration, casually forming itself into the shape of a twelve-penny oath---without the sin or substance of one. </ps>


</p> 
<p>

Others, and especially one or two who sat next him, looked upon it on the contrary, as a real and substantial oath propensly formed against
<em>Yorick,</em>
to whom he was known to bear no good liking--- which said oath, as my father philosophized upon it, actually lay fretting and fuming at that very time in the upper regions of
<em>Phutatorius's</em>
purtenance; and so was naturally, and according to the due course of things, first squeezed out by the sudden influx of blood, which was driven into the right ventricle of
<em>Phutatorius's</em>
heart, by the stroke of surprize which so strange a theory of preaching had excited.

<p>
How finely we argue upon mistaken facts! 
</p> 
<p>

There was not a soul busied in all these various reasonings upon the monosyllable which
<em>Phutatorius</em>
uttered,---who did not take this for granted, proceeding upon it as from an axiom, namely, that
<em>Phutatorius's</em>
mind was intent upon the subject of debate which was arising between
<em>Didius</em>
and
<em>Yorick</em>
; and indeed as he looked first towards the one, and then towards the other, with the air of a man listening to what was going forwards,--- who would not have thought the same?


<ps>
But the truth was, that
<em>Phutatorius</em>
knew not one word or one syllable of what was passing---but his whole thoughts and attention were taken up with a transaction which was going forwards at that very instant within the precincts of his own

So that notwithstanding he looked with all the attention in the world, and had gradually skrewed up every nerve and muscle in his face, to the utmost pitch the instrument would bear, in order, as it was thought, to give a sharp reply to
<em>Yorick,</em>
who sat over-against him---Yet I say, was
<em>Yorick</em>
never once in any one domicile of
<em>Phutatorius's</em>
brain---but the true cause of his exclamation lay at least a yard below.

This I will endeavour to explain to you with all imaginable decency.

of fine chesnuts standing upon the dresser, had ordered that a hundred or two of them might be roasted and sent in, as soon as dinner was over---
<em>Gastripheres</em>
inforcing his orders about them, that
<em>Didius,</em>
but
<em>Phutatorius</em>
especially, were particularly fond of 'em.
</ps>


</p> 
<p>

About two minutes before the time that my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
interrupted
<em>Yorick's</em>
harangue---
<em>Gastripheres's</em>
chesnuts were brought in---and as
<em>Phutatorius's</em>
fondness for 'em, was uppermost in the waiter's head, he laid them directly before
<em>Phutatorius,</em>
wrapt up hot in a clean damask napkin.

than the rest, must be put in motion--- it so fell out, however, that one was actually sent rolling off the table; and as
<em>Phutatorius</em>
sat straddling under---it fell perpendicularly into that particular aperture of
<em>Phutatorius's</em>
breeches, for which, to the shame and indelicacy of our language be it spoke, there is no chaste word throughout all
<em>Johnson's</em>
dictionary---let it suffice to say---it was that particular aperture, which in all good societies, the laws of decorum do strictly require, like the temple of
<em>Janus</em>
(in peace at least) to be universally shut up.
</ps>


</p> 
<p>

The neglect of this punctilio in
<em>Phutatorius</em>
(which by the bye should be a warning to all mankind) had opened a door to this accident.---

---Accident, I call it, in compliance to a received mode of speaking,---but in no opposition to the opinion either of
<em>Acrites</em>
or
<em>Mythogeras</em>
in this matter; I know they were both prepossessed and fully persuaded of it---and are so to this hour, That there was nothing of accident in the whole event---but that the chesnut's taking that particular course, and in a manner of its accord---and then falling with all its heat directly into that one particular place, and no other--- was a real judgment upon
<em>Phutatorius,</em>
for that filthy and obscene treatise
<em>de Concubinis retinendis,</em>
which
<em>Phutatorius</em>
had published about twenty years ago--- and was that identical week going to give the world a second edition of.

may be wrote on both sides of the question---all that concerns me as an historian, is to represent the matter of fact, and render it credible to the reader, that the hiatus in
<em>Phutatorius's</em>
breeches was sufficiently wide to receive the chesnut; ---and that the chesnut, some how or other, did fall perpendicularly and piping hot into it, without
<em>Phutatorius's</em>
perceiving it, or any one else at that time.
</ps>


</p> 
<p>

The genial warmth which the chesnut imparted, was not undelectable for the first twenty or five and twenty seconds,--- and did no more than gently solicit
<em>Phutatorius's</em>
attention towards the part:---


<ps>
But the heat gradually increasing, and in a few seconds more getting beyond the point of all sober pleasure, and then advancing with all speed into the regions of pain,---the soul of

</p> 
<p>

With the best intelligence which all these messengers could bring him back,
<em>Phutatorius</em>
was not able to dive into the secret of what was going forwards below, nor could he make any kind of conjecture, what the devil was the matter with it:


<ps>However, as he knew not what the true cause might turn out, he deemed it most prudent, in the situation he was in at present, to bear it, if possible, like a stoick; which, with the help of some </ps>

<em>Newt</em>
or an
<em>Asker,</em>
or some such detested reptile, had crept up, and was fastening his teeth---the horrid idea of which, with a fresh glow of pain arising that instant from the chesnut, seized
<em>Phutatorius</em>
with a sudden panick, and in the first terrifying disorder of the passion it threw him, as it has done the best generals upon earth, quite off his guard;---the effect of which was this, that he leapt incontinently up, uttering as he rose that interjection of surprise so

<em>Phutatorius</em>
could no more help than he could the cause of it.

</p> 
<p>

Though this has taken up some time in the narrative, it took up little more time in the transaction, than just to allow time for
<em>Phutatorius</em>
to draw forth the chesnut, and throw it down with violence upon the floor---and for
<em>Yorick,</em>
to rise from his chair, and pick the chesnut up.

<em>Yorick,</em>
I said, picked up the chesnut which
<em>Phutatorius's</em>
wrath had flung down---the action was trifling---I am ashamed to account for it---he did it, for no reason, but that he thought the chesnut not a jot worse for the adventure ---and that he held a good chesnut worth stooping for.


---But this incident, trifling as it was, wrought differently in
<em>Phutatorius's</em>
head:


<ps>
He considered this act of
<em>Yorick's,</em>
in getting off his chair, and picking up the chesnut, as a plain acknowledgment in him, that the chesnut

<br>

<ps>was originally his,---and in course, that it must have been the owner of the chesnut, and no one else, who could have plaid him such a prank with it: </ps>


What greatly confirmed him in this opinion, was this, that the table being parallelogramical and very narrow, it afforded a fair opportunity for
<em>Yorick,</em>
who sat directly over-against
<em>Phutatorius,</em>
of slipping the chesnut in---and consequently that he did it.


The look of something more than suspicion, which
<em>Phutatorius</em>
cast full upon
<em>Yorick</em>
as these thoughts arose, too evidently spoke his opinion---and as
<em>Phutatorius</em>
was naturally supposed to know more of the matter than any person besides, his opinion at once became the general one;---and for a reason very different from any which have been yet given---in a little time it was put out of all manner of dispute.

When great or unexpected events fall out upon the stage of this sublunary world---the mind of man, which is an inquisitive kind of a substance, naturally takes a flight, behind the scenes, to see what is the cause and first spring of them---The search was not long in this instance.

<p>

It was well known that
<em>Yorick</em>
had never a good opinion of the treatise which
<em>Phutatorius</em>
had wrote
<em>de Concubinis retinendis,</em>
as a thing which he feared had done hurt in the world---and 'twas easily found out, that there was a mystical meaning in
<em>Yorick's</em>
prank---and that his chucking the chesnut hot into

<p>
This, as the reader has seen from one end to the other, was as groundless as the dreams of philosophy: 

<em>Yorick,</em>
no doubt, as
<em>Shakespear</em>
said of his ancestor ---"
<em>was a man of jest,</em>
" but it was temper'd with something which withheld him from that, and many other ungracious pranks, of which he as undeservedly bore the blame;---but it was his misfortune all his life long to bear the imputation of saying and doing a thousand things of which (unless my esteem blinds me) his nature was incapable.

In every ill usage of that sort, he acted precisely as in the affair of his lean horse---he could have explained it to his honour, but his spirit was above it; and besides he ever looked upon the inventor, the propagator and believer of an illiberal report alike so injurious to him,---he could not stoop to tell his story to them---and so trusted to time and truth to do it for him. 
</p> 
<p>

This heroic cast produced him inconveniences in many respects---in the present, it was followed by the fixed resentment of

<p>

This determination, continued

how contrary soever it may seem to run to the stream of vulgar ideas, yet had reason strongly on its side; and has been put out of all manner of dispute from the famous case, known commonly by the name of the Duke of
<em>Suffolk's</em>
case:


---It is cited in
<em>Brook,</em>
said
<em>Triptolemus</em>
---And taken notice of by Lord
<em>Coke,</em>
added
<em>Didius</em>
---And you may find it in
<em>Swinburn</em>

was this.

</p> 
<p>

In the reign of
<em>Edward</em>
the Sixth,
<em>Charles</em>
Duke of
<em>Suffolk</em>
having issue a son by one venter, and a daughter by another venter, made his last will, wherein he devised goods to his son, and died; after whose death the son died also---but without will, without wife, and without child---his mother and his sister by the father's side (for she was born of the former venter) then living.


The mother took the administration of her son's goods, according to the statute of the 21st of
<em>Harry</em>
the Eighth, whereby it is enacted, That in case any person die intestate, the administration of his goods shall be committed to the next of kin.

<br>

<p>
The administration being thus (surreptitiously) granted to the mother, the sister by the father's side commenced a suit before the Ecclesiastical Judge, alledging, 1st, That she herself was next of kin; and 2dly, That the mother was not of kin at all to the party deceased; and therefore pray'd the court, that the administration granted to the mother might be revoked, and be committed unto her, as next of kin to the deceased, by force of the said statute. 
</p> 
<p>


<ps>Hereupon, as it was a great cause, and much depending upon its issue--- and many causes of great property likely to be decided in times to come, by the precedent to be then made---the most learned, as well in the laws of this realm, as in the civil law, were consulted together, whether the mother was of kin to </ps>

---Whereunto not only the temporal lawyers---but the church-lawyers ---the juris consulti---the jurisprudentes ---the civilians---the advocates ---the commissaries---the judges of the consistory and prerogative courts of

</p> 
<p>

'Tis a ground and principle in the law, said
<em>Triptolemus,</em>
that things do not ascend, but descend in it; and I make no doubt 'tis for this cause, that however true it is, that the child may be of the blood or seed of its parents---that the parents, nevertheless, are not of the blood and seed of it; inasmuch as the parents are not begot by the child, but the child by the parents---For so they write,
<em>Liberi sunt de sanguine patris &amp; matris, sed pater et mater non sunt de sanguine liberorum</em>
.

</p>

<ps>
that the mother is not of kin to her child---but the father likewise---It is held, said
<em>Triptolemus,</em>
the better opinion; because the father, the mother, and the child, though they be three persons, yet are they but (
<em>una caro</em>

) one flesh; and consequently no degree of kindred---or any method of acquiring one
<em>in nature</em>
---There you push the argument again too far, cried

--- for there is no prohibition

though there is in the levitical law,--- but that a man may beget a child upon his grandmother---in which case, supposing the issue a daughter, she would stand in relation both of---But who ever thought, cried

<ps>
the two old projects, the
<strong>Ox-moor</strong>
and my BROTHER, divided him again; and so equal a match were they for each other, as to become the occasion of no small contest in the old gentleman's mind,--- which of the two should be set o'going first.
</ps>


</p> 
<p>
---People may laugh as they will--- but the case was this. 
</p> 
<p>


<ps>It had ever been the custom of the family, and by length of time was almost become a matter of common right, that the eldest son of it should have free ingress, egress, and regress into foreign parts before marriage,---not only for the sake of bettering his own private parts, by the benefit of exercise and change of so much air---but simply for the mere delectation of his fancy, by the feather </ps>

Now as this was a reasonable, and in course a most christian indulgence---to deprive him of it, without why or wherefore,---and thereby make an example of him, as the first

unwhirl'd about
<em>Europe</em>
in a post-chaise, and only because he was a heavy lad--- would be using him ten times worse than a

On the other hand, the case of the

was full as hard.

It had been moreover in possession of the

-family ever since the middle of the last century; and though it lay full in view before the house, bounded on one extremity by the water-mill, and on the other by the projected windmill spoken of above,---and for all these reasons seemed to have the fairest title of any part of the estate to the care and protection of the family---yet by an unaccountable fatality, common to men, as well as the ground they tread on,---it had all along most shamefully been overlook'd; and to speak the truth of it, had suffered so much by it, that it would have made any man's heart have bled (

<ps>it, and only seen the condition it was in. </ps>


</p> 
<p>
However, as neither the purchasing this tract of ground---nor indeed the placing of it where it lay, were either of them, properly speaking, of my father's doing---he had never thought himself any way concerned in the affair---till the fifteen years before, when the breaking out of that cursed law-suit mentioned above (and which had arose about its boundaries)---which being altogether my father's own act and deed, it naturally awakened every other argument in its favour; and upon summing them all up together, he saw, not merely in interest, but in honour, he was bound to do something for it---and that now or never was the time.

<br>

<p>


<ps>
I think there must certainly have been a mixture of ill-luck in it, that the reasons on both sides should happen to be so equally balanced by each other; for though my father weigh'd them in all humours and conditions---spent many an anxious hour in the most profound and abstracted meditation upon what was best to be done---reading books of farming one day---books of travels another ---laying aside all passion whatever ---viewing the arguments on both sides in all their lights and circumstances--- communing every day with my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
---arguing with
<em>Yorick,</em>
and talking over the whole affair of the
<em>Ox-moor</em>
with
<em>Obadiah</em>
---yet nothing in all that time appeared so strongly in behalf of the one, which was not either strictly applicable to the other, or at least so far counterbalanced by some consideration

<br>

<ps>of equal weight, as to keep the scales even. </ps>


</p> 
<p>

For to be sure, with proper helps, and in the hands of some people, tho' the
<em>Ox-moor</em>
would undoubtedly have made a different appearance in the world from what it did, or ever would do in the condition it lay---yet every tittle of this was true, with regard to my brother
<em>Bobby</em>
---let
<em>Obadiah</em>
say what he would.---

</p> 
<p>


<ps>
In point of interest---the contest, I own, at first sight, did not appear so undecisive betwixt them; for whenever my father took pen and ink in hand, and set about calculating the simple expence of paring and burning, and fencing in the
<em>Ox-moor,</em>
&amp;c. &amp;c.---with the certain profit it would bring him in

<ps>
return---the latter turned out so prodigiously in his way of working the account, that you would have sworn the
<em>Ox-moor</em>
would have carried all before it.
</ps>


For it was plain he should reap a hundred lasts of rape, at twenty pounds a last, the very first year---besides an excellent crop of wheat the year following---and the year after that, to speak within bounds, a hundred--- but, in all likelihood, a hundred and fifty---if not two hundred quarters of pease and beans---besides potatoes without end---But then, to think he was all this while breeding up my brother like a hog to eat them---knocked all on the head again, and generally left the old gentleman in such a state of suspence--- that, as he often declared to my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
---he knew no more than his heels what to do.

<p>
No body, but he who has felt it, can conceive what a plaguing thing it is to have a man's mind torn asunder by two projects of equal strength, both obstinately pulling in a contrary direction at the same time: 
For to say nothing of the havock, which by a certain consequence is unavoidably made by it all over the finer system of the nerves, which you know convey the animal spirits and more subtle juices from the heart to the head, and so on------It is not to be told in what a degree such a wayward kind of friction works upon the more gross and solid parts, wasting the fat and impairing the strength of a man every time as it goes backwards and forwards.

Was I left like

And as the bilious and more saturnine passions, by creating disorders in the blood and humours, have as bad an influence, I see, upon the body politick as body natural---and as nothing but a habit of virtue can fully govern those passions, and subject them to reason---I should add to my prayer---that God would give my subjects grace to be as WISE as they were MERRY; and then should I be the happiest monarch, and they the happiest people under heaven---

Shall we for ever make new books, as apothecaries make new mixtures, by pouring only out of one vessel into another? 
</p> 
<p>
Are we for ever to be twisting, and untwisting the same rope? for ever in the same track---for ever at the same pace? 
</p> 
<p>

Shall we be destined to the days of eternity, on holy-days, as well as working-days, to be shewing the

as monks do the relicks of their saints---without working one---one single miracle with them?

---You are half asleep, my good lady, said the old gentleman, taking hold of the old lady's hand, and giving it a gentle squeeze, as he pronounced the word
<em>Whiskers</em>
---shall we change the subject?

By no means, replied the old lady---I like your account of these matters: so throwing a thin gauze handkerchief over her head, and leaning it back upon the chair with her face turned towards him, and advancing her two feet as she reclined herself---I desire, continued she, you will go on. 
</p> 
<p>
The old gentleman went on as follows.

---Whiskers! cried the queen of

uttered the word---Whiskers;

madam, said
<em>La Fosseuse,</em>
pinning the ball to the queen's apron, and making a courtesy as she repeated it.
</ps>


</p> 
<p>


<em>La Fosseuse's</em>
voice was naturally soft and low, yet 'twas an articulate voice: and every letter of the word
<em>whiskers</em>
fell distinctly upon the queen of
<em>Navarre's</em>
ear---Whiskers! cried the queen, laying a greater stress upon the word, and as if she had still distrusted her ears---Whiskers; replied
<em>La Fosseuse,</em>
repeating the word a third time---There is not a cavalier, madam, of his age in
<em>Navarre,</em>
continued the maid of honour, pressing the page's interest upon the queen, that has so gallant a pair---Of what? cried
<em>Margaret,</em>
smiling---Of whiskers, said
<em>La Fosseuse,</em>
with infinite modesty.

<p>

The word whiskers still stood its ground, and continued to be made use of in most of the best companies throughout the little kingdom of
<em>Navarre,</em>
notwithstanding the indiscreet use which
<em>La Fosseuse</em>
had made of it: the truth was,
<em>La Fosseuse</em>
had pronounced the word, not only before the queen, but upon sundry other occasions at court, with an accent which always implied something of a mystery---And as the court of
<em>Margaret,</em>
as all the world knows, was at that time a mixture of gallantry and devotion ---and whiskers being as applicable to the one, as the other, the word naturally stood its ground---it gain'd full as much as it lost; that is, the clergy were for it---the laity were against it--- and for the women,---
<em>they</em>
were divided.---

The excellency of the figure and mien of the young Sieur
<em>de Croix,</em>
was at that time beginning to draw the attention of the maids of honour towards the terras before the palace gate, where the guard was mounted.


The Lady
<em>de Baussiere</em>
fell deeply in love with him,---
<em>La Battarelle</em>
did the same---it was the finest weather for it, that ever was remembered in
<em>Navarre---La Guyol, La Maronette, La Sabatiere,</em>
fell in love with the Sieur

also---

<em>De Croix</em>
had failed in an attempt to recommend himself to

and

were inseparable.

at the conclusion of his work, that Noses ran the same fate some centuries ago in most parts of

which whiskers have now done in the kingdom of

---The evil indeed spread no further then---, but have not beds and bolsters, and night-caps and chamber-pots stood upon the brink of destruction ever since?

Are not trouse, and placket-holes, and pump-handles---and spigots and faucets, in danger still, from the same association?

of DELICACY, and the

<strong>When</strong>
my father received the letter which brought him the melancholy account of my brother
<em>Bobby's</em>
death, he was busy calculating the expence of his riding post from
<em>Calais</em>
to
<em>Paris,</em>
and so on to
<em>Lyons</em>
.

</p> 
<p>


<ps>'Twas a most inauspicious journey; my father having had every foot of it to travel over again, and his calculation to begin afresh, when he had almost got </ps>

<ps>
to the end of it, by
<em>Obadiah's</em>
opening the door to acquaint him the family was out of yeast---and to ask whether he might not take the great coach-horse early in the morning, and ride in search of some.
</ps>


---With all my heart,
<em>Obadiah,</em>
said my father, (pursuing his journey)--- take the coach-horse, and welcome.


--- But he wants a shoe, poor creature! said
<em>Obadiah</em>
.


---Poor creature! said my uncle
<em>Toby,</em>
vibrating the note back again, like a string in unison.


Then ride the
<em>Scotch</em>
horse, quoth my father hastily.


He cannot bear a saddle upon his back, quoth
<em>Obadiah,</em>
for the whole world.


--- The devil's in that horse; then take
<strong>Patriot,</strong>
cried my father, and shut the door.


---
<strong>Patriot</strong>
is sold, said
<em>Obadiah</em>
.


---Here's for you! cried my father, making a pause, and looking in my uncle
<em>Toby's</em>
face, as if the thing had not been a matter of fact.


<ps>---Your worship </ps>

ordered me to sell him last
<em>April,</em>
said
<em>Obadiah</em>
.
</ps>

---Then go on foot for your pains, cried my father. 

---I had much rather walk than ride, said
<em>Obadiah,</em>
shutting the door.

</p> 
<p>
What plagues! cried my father, going on with his calculation. 

---But the waters are out, said
<em>Obadiah,</em>
---opening the door again.

</p> 
<p>

Till that moment, my father, who had a map of
<em>Sanson's,</em>
and a book of the post roads before him, had kept his hand upon the head of his compasses, with one foot of them fixed upon
<em>Nevers,</em>
the last stage he had paid for---purposing to go on from that point with his journey and calculation, as soon as
<em>Obadiah</em>
quitted the room; but this second attack of
<em>Obadiah's,</em>
in opening the door and laying the whole country under water, was too much.


<ps>---He let go his compasses---or rather </ps>

<ps>
with a mixed motion betwixt accident and anger, he threw them upon the table; and then there was nothing for him to do, but to return back to
<em>Calais</em>
(like many others) as wise as he had set out.
</ps>


</p> 
<p>

When the letter was brought into the parlour, which contained the news of my brother's death, my father had got forwards again upon his journey to within a stride of the compasses of the very same stage of
<em>Nevers</em>
.


---By your leave, Mons.
<em>Sanson,</em>
cried my father, striking the point of his compasses through
<em>Nevers</em>
into the table,---and nodding to my uncle
<em>Toby,</em>
to see what was in the letter, ---twice of one night is too much for an
<em>English</em>
gentleman and his son, Mons.
<em>Sanson,</em>
to be turned back from so lousy a town as
<em>Nevers,</em>
---what think'st thou,
<em>Toby,</em>
added my father in a sprightly tone.


<ps>
---Unless it be a garrison town, said my uncle
<em>Toby,</em>
---for then---I shall be a fool,

<ps>said my father, smiling to himself, as long as I live. </ps>


---So giving a second nod ---and keeping his compasses still upon
<em>Nevers</em>
with one hand, and holding his book of the post-roads in the other--- half calculating and half listening, he leaned forwards upon the table with both elbows, as my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
hummed over the letter.

No:--- he is dead, my dear brother, quoth my uncle

---Without being ill? cried my father again.

in a low voice, and fetching a deep sigh from the bottom of his

When

was told of her son's death,
<em>Tacitus</em>
informs us, that not being able to moderate the violence of her passions, she abruptly broke off her work ---My father stuck his compasses into

but so much the faster.


---What contrarieties! his, indeed, was matter of calculation---
<em>Agrippina's</em>
must have been quite a different affair; who else could pretend to reason from history?

How my father went on, in my opinion, deserves a chapter to itself.---

My father managed his affliction otherwise; and indeed differently from most men either ancient or modern; for he neither wept it away, as the

<p>

When
<em>Tully</em>
was bereft of his dear daughter
<em>Tullia,</em>
at first he laid it to his heart,---he listened to the voice of nature, and modulated his own unto it.


---O my
<em>Tullia</em>
! my daughter! my child!---still, still, still,---'twas O my
<em>Tullia</em>
!---my
<em>Tullia</em>
!


Methinks I see my
<em>Tullia,</em>
I hear my
<em>Tullia,</em>
I talk with my

--- But as soon as he began to look into the stores of philosophy, and consider how many excellent things might be said upon the occasion---no body upon earth can conceive, says the great orator, how happy, how joyful it made me.

<ps>could be for his life, and for aught I am convinced of to the contrary at present, with as much reason: it was indeed his strength---and his weakness too. </ps>

---His strength---for he was by nature eloquent, ---and his weakness---for he was hourly a dupe to it; and provided an occasion in life would but permit him to shew his talents, or say either a wise thing, a witty, or a shrewd one---(bating the case of a systematick misfortune)---he had all he wanted. 

---A blessing which tied up my father's tongue, and a misfortune which set it loose with a good grace, were pretty equal: sometimes, indeed, the misfortune was the better of the two; for instance, where the pleasure of the harangue was as
<em>ten,</em>
and the pain of the misfortune but as
<em>five</em>
---my father gained half in half, and consequently was as well again off, as it never had befallen him.

My father had a favourite little mare, which he had consigned over to a most beautiful Arabian horse, in order to have a pad out of her for his own riding: he was sanguine in all his projects; so talked about his pad every day with as absolute a security, as if it had been reared, broke,---and bridled and saddled at his door ready for mounting. 

By some neglect or other in
<em>Obadiah,</em>
it so fell out, that my father's expectations were answered with nothing better than a mule, and as ugly a beast of the kind as ever was produced.

on the right hand,

on the left.

Now my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
knew not that this last paragraph was an extract of
<em>Servius Sulpicius's</em>
consolatory letter to
<em>Tully</em>
.

--- He had as little skill, honest man, in the fragments, as he had in the whole pieces of antiquity. 

---And as my father, whilst he was concerned in the
<em>Turky</em>
trade, had been three or four different times in the
<em>Levant,</em>
in one of which he had staid a whole year and a half at
<em>Zant,</em>
my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
naturally concluded, that in some one of these periods he had taken a trip across the
<em>Archipelago</em>
into
<em>Asia</em>
; and that all this sailing affair with
<em>&AElig;gina</em>
behind, and
<em>Megara</em>
before, and
<em>Pyr&aelig;us</em>
on the right hand,
<em>&amp;c. &amp;c.</em>
was nothing more than the true course of my father's voyage and reflections.


---'Twas certainly in his
<em>manner,</em>
and many an undertaking critick would have built two stories higher upon worse foundations.

---'Twas no year of our Lord, replied my father. 

---That's impossible, cried my uncle

Simpleton! said my father,---'twas forty years before Christ was born.

My uncle

had but two things for it; either to suppose his brother to be the wandering

or that his misfortunes had disordered his brain.


---"May the Lord God of heaven and earth protect him and restore him," said my uncle
<em>Toby,</em>
praying silently for my father, and with tears in his eyes.

<p>
---My father placed the tears to a proper account, and went on with his harangue with great spirit.

setting off, by the bye, was not likely to cure my uncle

suspicions.

---"Labour, sorrow, grief, sickness, want, and woe, are the sauces of life." 

--- Much good may do them---said my uncle

<strong>My</strong>
mother was going very gingerly in the dark along the passage which led to the parlour, as my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
pronounced the word
<em>wise</em>
.


---'Tis a shrill, penetrating sound of itself, and
<em>Obadiah</em>
had helped it by leaving the door a little a-jar, so that my mother heard enough of it, to imagine herself the subject of the conversation: so laying the edge of her finger across her two lips--- holding in her breath, and bending her head a little downwards, with a twist of her neck---(not towards the door, but from it, by which means her ear was brought to the chink)---she listened with all her powers:---the listening slave, with the Goddess of Silence at his back, could not have given a finer thought for an intaglio.

<strong>Though</strong>
in one sense, our family was certainly a simple machine, as it consisted of a few wheels; yet there was thus much to be said for it, that these wheels were set in motion by so many different springs, and acted one upon the other from such a variety of strange principles and impulses,---that though it was a simple machine, it had all the honour and advantages of a complex one,---and a number of as odd movements within it, as ever were beheld in the inside of a
<em>Dutch</em>
silk-mill.

<ps>was not altogether so singular, as in many others; and it was this, that whatever motion, debate, harangue, dialogue, project, or dissertation, was going forwards in the parlour, there was generally another at the same time, and upon the same subject, running parallel along with it in the kitchen. </ps>


</p> 
<p>


<ps>Now to bring this about, whenever an extraordinary message, or letter, was delivered in the parlour,---or a discourse suspended till a servant went out---or the lines of discontent were observed to hang upon the brows of my father or mother ---or, in short, when any thing was supposed to be upon the tapis worth knowing or listening to, 'twas the rule to leave the door, not absolutely shut, but somewhat a-jar---as it stands just now,---which, under covert of the bad hinge, (and that possibly might be one of the many reasons why it was never mended) it was not difficult to manage; by which means, </ps>

in all these cases, a passage was generally left, not indeed as wide as the

but wide enough, for all that, to carry on as much of this windward trade, as was sufficient to save my father the trouble of governing his house;---my mother at this moment stands profiting by it.

did the same thing, as soon as he had left the letter upon the table which brought the news of my brother's death; so that before my father had well got over his surprize, and entered upon his harangue,---had

got upon his legs, to speak his sentiments upon the subject.

<p>

A curious observer of nature, had he been worth the inventory of all

stock---though, by the bye,

We had a fat foolish scullion---my father, I think, kept her for her simplicity; ---she had been all autumn struggling with a dropsy. 

---He is dead, said

---he is certainly dead!

---So am not I, said the foolish scullion.

---Here is sad news,

wiping her eyes as

step'd into the kitchen,---master

---You hope not! cried

earnestly.


---The mourning ran not in

head, whatever it did in

---I hope, said
<em>Trim,</em>
explaining himself, I hope in God the news is not true.


---I heard the letter read with my own ears, answered
<em>Obadiah</em>
; and we shall have a terrible piece of work of it in stubbing the ox-moor.


---Oh! he's dead, said
<em>Susannah</em>
.

---As sure, said the scullion, as I am alive. 
</p> 
<p>

I lament for him from my heart and my soul, said

fetching a sigh.

--- Poor creature!---poor boy! poor gentleman!

<p>

---He was alive last

said the coachman.

Are we not here now, continued the corporal, (striking the end of his stick perpendicularly upon the floor, so as to give an idea of health and stability)---and are we not--- (dropping his hat upon the ground) gone! in a moment! 
---'Twas infinitely striking! 

<em>Susannah</em>
burst into a flood of tears.

---We are not stocks and stones.

---The foolish fat scullion herself, who was scouring a fish-kettle upon her knees, was rous'd with it. 
---The whole kitchen crouded about the corporal.

<p>


<ps>Now as I perceive plainly, that the preservation of our constitution in church and state,---and possibly the preservation of the whole world---or what is the same thing, the distribution and balance of its property and power, may in time to come depend greatly upon the right understanding of this stroke of the corporal's </ps>

</p> 
<p>
I said, "we were not stocks and stones" ---'tis very well. 
I should have added, nor are we angels, I wish we were,---but men cloathed with bodies, and governed by our imaginations;---and what a junketting piece of work of it there is, betwixt these and our seven senses, especially some of them, for my own part, I own it, I am ashamed to confess. 

Let it suffice to affirm, that of all the senses, the eye (for I absolutely deny the touch, though most of your
<em>Barbati,</em>
I know, are for it) has the quickest commerce with the soul,---gives a smarter stroke, and leaves something more inexpressible upon the fancy, than words can either convey---or sometimes get rid of.

---I've gone a little about---no matter, 'tis for health---let us only carry it back in our mind to the mortality of

---"Are we not here now,---and gone in a moment?" 

---There was nothing in the sentence---'twas one of your self-evident truths we have the advantage of hearing every day; and if
<em>Trim</em>
had not trusted more to his hat than his head--- he had made nothing at all of it.

<p>
---"Are we not here now;"--- continued the corporal, "and are we not" ---(dropping his hat plumb upon the ground---and pausing, before he pronounced the word)---"gone! in a moment?" 

<ps>The descent of the hat was as if a heavy lump of clay had been kneaded into the crown of it---Nothing could have expressed the sentiment of mortality, of which it was the type and forerunner, like it,---his hand seemed to vanish from under it,---it fell dead,---the corporal's eye fix'd upon it, as upon a </ps>

burst into a flood of tears.
</ps>


</p> 
<p>
Now---Ten thousand, and ten thousand times ten thousand (for matter and motion are infinite) are the ways by which a hat may be dropped upon the ground, without any effect. 
---Had he flung it, or thrown it, or cast it, or skimmed it, or squirted, or let it slip or fall in any possible direction under heaven, ---or in the best direction that could be given to it,---had he dropped it like a goose---like a puppy---like an ass---or in doing it, or even after he had done, had he looked like a fool---like a ninny--- like a nicompoop---it had fail'd, and the effect upon the heart had been lost.

<strong>Whether</strong>

by taking her hand too suddenly from off the corporal's shoulder, (by the whisking about of her passions)---broke a little the chain of his reflections---

For my own part, I declare it, that out of doors, I value not death at all:---not this .. added the corporal, snapping his fingers,---but with an air which no one but the corporal could have given to the sentiment---In battle, I value death not this . . . and let him not take me cowardly, like poor

<p>


<strong>The</strong>
first thing which entered my father's head, after affairs were a little settled in the family, and
<em>Susannah</em>
had got possession of my mother's green sattin night-gown,---was to sit down coolly, after the example of
<em>Xenophon,</em>
and write a
<strong>Tristra</strong>
-
<em>p&aelig;dia,</em>
or system of education for me; collecting first for that purpose his own scattered thoughts, counsels, and notions; and binding them together, so as to form an INSTITUTE for the government of my childhood and adolescence.


<br>
<br>
<small><font color="red">

<br>
<a href="/displayFigure.do?id=tsv5p079.tif"><img style="border:1px solid #000" alt="View Figure" src="/thumbnails/tn_tsv5p079.gif"></a>
<br>

I was my father's last stake--- he had lost my brother
<em>Bobby</em>
entirely,--- he had lost, by his own computation, full three fourths of me---that is, he had been unfortunate in his three first great casts for me---my geniture, nose, and name,---there was but this one left; and accordingly my father gave himself up to it with as much devotion as ever my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
had done to his doctrine of projectils.


---The difference between them was, that my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
drew his whole knowledge of projectils from
<em>Nicholas Tartaglia</em>
---My father spun his, every thread of it, out of his own brain,---or reeled and cross-twisted what all other spinners and spinsters had spun before him, that 'twas pretty near the same torture to him.

</p> 
<p>
In about three years, or something more, my father had got advanced almost into the middle of his work. 
---Like all other writers, he met with disappointments. 

<br>
<br>

<br>
---He imagined he should be able to bring whatever he had to say, into so small compass, that when it was finished and bound, it might be rolled up in my mother's hussive. 
---Matter grows under our hands. 

---Let no man say,---"Come---I'll write a
<em>duodecimo</em>
."

</p> 
<p>

My father gave himself up to it, however, with the most painful diligence, proceeding step by step in every line, with the same kind of caution and circumspection (though I cannot say upon quite so religious a principle) as was used by
<em>John de la Casse,</em>
the lord archbishop of
<em>Benevento,</em>
in compassing his
<em>Galatea</em>
; in which his Grace of
<em>Benevento</em>
spent near forty years of his life; and when the thing came out, it was not of above half the size or the thickness of a
<em>Rider's</em>
Almanack.

or playing at
<em>primero</em>
with his chaplain, ---would pose any mortal not let into the true secret;---and therefore 'tis worth explaining to the world, was it only for the encouragement of those few in it, who write not so much to be fed---as to be famous.
</ps>


</p> 
<p>

I own had
<em>John de la Casse,</em>
the archbishop of
<em>Benevento,</em>
for whose memory (notwithstanding his
<em>Galatea</em>
) I retain the highest veneration,---had he been, Sir, a slender clerk,---of dull wit---slow parts---costive head, and so forth,---he and his
<em>Galatea</em>
might have jogged on together to the age of
<em>Methusalah</em>
for me,---the ph&aelig;nomenon had not been worth a parenthesis.---

</p> 
<p>


<ps>
But the reverse of this was the truth:
<em>John de la Casse</em>
was a genius of fine parts and fertile fancy; and yet with all these great advantages of nature, which should

<ps>
have pricked him forwards with his
<em>Galatea,</em>
he lay under an impuissance at the same time of advancing above a line and an half in the compass of a whole summer's day: this disability in his Grace arose from an opinion he was afflicted with,---which opinion was this,---
<em>viz.</em>
that whenever a Christian was writing a book (not for his private amusement, but) where his intent and purpose was
<em>bona fide,</em>
to print and publish it to the world, his first thoughts were always the temptations of the evil one.
</ps>

---This was the state of ordinary writers: but when a personage of venerable character and high station, either in church or state, once turned author,---he maintained that from the very moment he took pen in hand---all the devils in hell broke out of their holes to cajole him. 

<ps>---'Twas Term-time with them,---every thought, first and last, was captious;---how specious </ps>

<br>

<ps>and good soever,---'twas all one; ---in whatever form or colour it presented itself to the imagination,---'twas still a stroke of one or other of 'em levelled at him, and was to be fenced off. </ps>


---So that the life of a writer, whatever he might fancy to the contrary, was not so much a state of
<em>composition,</em>
as a state of
<em>warfare</em>
; and his probation in it, precisely that of any other man militant upon earth,---both depending alike, not half so much upon the degrees of his WIT--- as his RESISTANCE.

</p> 
<p>

My father was hugely pleased with this theory of
<em>John de la Casse,</em>
archbishop of
<em>Benevento</em>
; and (had it not cramped him a little in his creed) I believe would have given ten of the best acres in the
<em><a href='#Hit130' class='hitmarker' title='View previous hit'><i class="icon-caret-left"></i></a><a name='Hit131'></a><span class="hit">Shandy</span><a href='#Hit132' class='hitmarker' title='View next hit'><i class="icon-caret-right"></i></a></em>

<ps>
religious notions, in the progress of this work: 'tis enough to say here, as he could not have the honour of it, in the literal sense of the doctrine---he took up with the allegory of it;---and would often say, especially when his pen was a little retrograde, there was as much good meaning, truth, and knowledge, couched under the veil of
<em>John de la Casse's</em>
parabolical representation,---as was to be found in any one poetic fiction, or mystic record of antiquity.
</ps>


---Prejudice of education, he would say,
<em>is the devil,</em>
---and the multitudes of them which we suck in with our mother's milk---
<em>are the devil and all</em>
.


---We are haunted with them, brother
<em>Toby,</em>
in all our lucubrations and researches; and was a man fool enough to submit tamely to what they obtruded upon him,---what would his book be?


<ps>Nothing,---he would add, throwing his pen away with a vengeance, ---nothing but a farrago of the clack of </ps>

<ps>nurses, and of the nonsense of the old women (of both sexes) throughout the kingdom. </ps>


</p> 
<p>

This is the best account I am determined to give of the slow progress my father made in his
<em>Tristra-p&aelig;dia</em>
; at which (as I said) he was three years and something more, indefatigably at work, and at last, had scarce compleated, by his own reckoning, one half of his undertaking: the misfortune was, that I was all that time totally neglected and abandoned to my mother; and what was almost as bad, by the very delay, the first part of the work, upon which my father had spent the most of his pains, was rendered entirely useless,---every day a page or two became of no consequence.---

</p> 
<p>


<ps>---Certainly it was ordained as a scourge upon the pride of human wisdom, </ps>

<ps>That the wisest of us all, should thus outwit ourselves, and eternally forego our purposes in the intemperate act of pursuing them. </ps>


</p> 
<p>
In short, my father was so long in all his acts of resistance,---or in other words, ---he advanced so very slow with his work, and I began to live and get forwards at such a rate, that if an event had not happened,---which, when we get to it, if it can be told with decency, shall not be concealed a moment from the reader---I verily believe, I had put by my father, and left him drawing a sun-dial, for no better purpose than to be buried under ground.

<strong>The</strong>

---He determined at once, not to take shelter behind

before my uncle

My uncle
<em>Toby</em>
had just then been giving
<em>Yorick</em>
an account of the Battle of
<em>Steenkirk,</em>
and of the strange conduct of count
<em>Solmes</em>
in ordering the foot to halt, and the horse to march where it could not act; which was directly contrary to the king's commands, and proved the loss of the day.

by the help of his forefinger, laid flat upon the table, and the edge of his hand striking a-cross it at right angles, made a shift to tell his story so, that priests and virgins might have listened to it;---and the story being told, ---the dialogue went on as follows.

<p>

Corporal
<em>Trim,</em>
replied my uncle

<em>Cutts's,---Mackay's,---Augus's,---Graham's</em>
---and
<em>Leven's,</em>
all cut to pieces;---and so had the
<em>English</em>
life guards too, had it not been for some regiments upon the right, who marched up boldly to their relief, and received the enemy's fire in their faces, before any one of their own platoons discharged a musket,---they'll go to heaven for it,---added

What signified his marching the horse, continued the corporal, where the ground was so strait, and the

had such a nation of hedges, and copses, and ditches, and fell'd trees laid this way and that to cover them; (as they always have.)


--- Count

had but just time to make her escape down the back stairs, as my mother came up the fore.

</p> 
<p>

Now, though I was old enough to have told the story myself,---and young enough, I hope, to have done it without malignity; yet
<em>Susannah,</em>
in passing by the kitchen, for fear of accidents, had left it in short-hand with the cook--- the cook had told it with a commentary to
<em>Jonathan,</em>
and
<em>Jonathan</em>
to
<em>Obadiah</em>
; so that by the time my father had rung the bell half a dozen times, to know what was the matter above,---was
<em>Obadiah</em>
enabled to give him a particular account of it, just as it had happened.

--- I thought as much, said my father, tucking up his night-gown;---and so walked up stairs.

<p>

One would imagine from this--- (though for my own part I somewhat question it)---that my father before that time, had actually wrote that remarkable chapter in the
<em>Tristrap&aelig;dia,</em>
which to me is the most original and entertaining one in the whole book;---and that is the
<em>chapter upon sash-windows,</em>
with a bitter
<em>Philippick</em>
at the end of it, upon the forgetfulness of chamber-maids.

--- I have but two reasons for thinking otherwise. 
</p> 
<p>


<ps>First, Had the matter been taken into consideration, before the event happened, my father certainly would have nailed up the sash-window for good an' all;--- which, considering with what difficulty he composed books,---he might have done with ten times less trouble, than he could have wrote the chapter: this argument I foresee holds good against his writing the chapter, even after the event; </ps>

<br>

<ps>but 'tis obviated under the second reason, which I have the honour to offer to the world in support of my opinion, that my father did not write the chapter upon sash-windows and chamber pots, at the time supposed,---and it is this. </ps>


</p>

---That, in order to render the

complete,---I wrote the chapter myself.

<strong>O</strong>
Blessed health! cried my father, making an exclamation, as he turned over the leaves to the next chapter, ---thou art above all gold and treasure; 'tis thou who enlargest the soul,--- and openest all it's powers to receive instruction and to relish virtue.

---He that has thee, has little more to wish for;--- and he that is so wretched as to want thee,---wants every thing with thee.

<ps>father, into a very little room, therefore we'll read the chapter quite thro'. </ps>


</p> 
<p>
My father read as follows. 
</p> 
<p>

"The whole secret of health depending upon the due contention for mastery betwixt the radical heat and the radical moisture"---You have proved that matter of fact, I suppose, above, said
<em>Yorick</em>
.

Sufficiently, replied my father. 
</p> 
<p>
In saying this, my father shut the book,---not as if he resolved to read no more of it, for he kept his forefinger in the chapter:---nor pettishly,---for he shut the book slowly; his thumb resting, when he had done it, upon the upperside of the cover, as his three fingers supported the lower side of it, without the least compressive violence.---

<p>

I have demonstrated the truth of that point, quoth my father, nodding to
<em>Yorick,</em>
most sufficiently in the preceding chapter.

</p> 
<p>

Now could the man in the moon be told, that a man in the earth had wrote a chapter, sufficiently demonstrating, That the secret of all health depended upon the due contention for mastery betwixt the
<em>radical heat</em>
and the
<em>radical moisture,</em>
--- and that he had managed the point so well, that there was not one single word wet or dry upon radical heat or radical moisture, throughout the whole chapter, ---or a single syllable in it,
<em>pro</em>
or
<em>con,</em>
directly or indirectly, upon the contention betwixt these two powers in any part of the animal oeconomy---

<strong>With</strong>
two strokes, the one at

the other at Lord

did my father atchieve it.

<p>

The stroke at the prince of physicians, with which he began, was no more than a short insult upon his sorrowful camplaint of the

.

---Life short, cried my father,---and the art of healing tedious!

<ps>which in all ages, they have first flatter'd the world, and at last deceived it. </ps>


</p> 
<p>

---O my lord
<em>Verulam</em>
! cried my father, turning from

and making his second stroke at him, as the principal of nostrum-mongers, and the fittest to be made an example of to the rest,---What shall I say to thee, my great lord
<em>Verulam</em>
?

What shall I say to thy internal spirit,---thy opium,---thy salt-petre,---thy greasy unctions,---thy daily purges,---thy nightly glisters, and succedaneums? 
</p> 
<p>
---My father was never at a loss what to say to any man, upon any subject; and had the least occasion for the exordium of any man breathing: how he dealt with his lordship's opinion,--- you shall see;---but when---I know not:---we must first see what his lordship's opinion was.

"
<strong>The</strong>
two great causes, which conspire with each other to shorten life, says lord
<em>Verulam,</em>
are first---

</p> 
<p>
"The internal spirit, which like a gentle flame, wastes the body down to death: 
---And secondly, the external air, that parches the body up to ashes:---which two enemies attacking us on both sides of our bodies together, at length destroy our organs, and render them unfit to carry on the functions of life."

<ps>but to repair the waste committed by the internal spirit, by making the substance of it more thick and dense, by a regular course of opiates on one side, and by refrigerating the heat of it on the other, by three grains and a half of salt-petre every morning before you got up.--- </ps>


</p> 
<p>
Still this frame of ours was left exposed to the inimical assaults of the air without; but this was fenced off again by a course of greasy unctions, which so fully saturated the pores of the skin, that no spicula could enter;------nor could any one get out. 
---This put a stop to all perspiration, sensible and insensible, which being the cause of so many scurvy distempers---a course of glisters was requisite to carry off redundant humours, ---and render the system compleat.

<strong>The</strong>
whole secret of health, said my father, beginning the sentence again, depending evidently upon the due contention betwixt the radical heat and radical moisture within us;---the least imaginable skill had been sufficient to have maintained it, had not the schoolmen confounded the task, merely (as
<em>Van Helmont,</em>
the famous chymist, has proved) by all along mistaking the radical moisture for the tallow and fat of animal bodies.

</p> 
<p>


<ps>Now the radical moisture is not the tallow or fat of animals, but an oily and balsamous substance; for the fat and tallow, as also the phlegm or watery </ps>

<ps>
parts are cold; whereas the oily and balsamous parts are of a lively heat and spirit, which accounts for the observation of
<em>Aristotle, "Quod omne animal post coitum est</em>
triste."
</ps>


</p> 
<p>

Now it is certain, that the radical heat lives in the radical moisture, but whether
<em>vice vers&acirc;,</em>
is a doubt: however, when the one decays, the other decays also; and then is produced, either an unnatural heat, which causes an unnatural dryness ---or an unnatural moisture, which causes dropsies.

---So that if a child, as he grows up, can but be taught to avoid running into fire or water, as either of 'em threaten his destruction,---'twill be all that is needful to be done upon that head.---

The poor fellow and I, quoth my uncle

---Now what can have got into that precious noddle of thine, my dear brother

All this was as much

to determine in which branch of learning your servant shines most, whether in physiology, or divinity.

<em>Slop</em>
had not forgot
<em>Trim's</em>
comment upon the sermon.---

<p>

It is but an hour ago, replied
<em>Yorick,</em>
since the corporal was examined in the latter, and pass'd muster with great honour.---

</p> 
<p>

The radical heat and moisture, quoth Doctor
<em>Slop,</em>
turning to my father, you must know, is the basis and foundation of our being,---as the root of a tree is the source and principle of its vegetation.

---It is inherent in the seeds of all animals, and may be preserved sundry ways, but principally in my opinion by

and
<em>occludents</em>
.


---Now this poor fellow, continued Dr.
<em>Slop,</em>
pointing to the corporal, has had the misfortune to have heard some superficial empiric discourse upon this nice point.

---That he has,---said my father. 
---Very likely, said my uncle. 

---I'm sure of it---quoth

<em>Yorick</em>
listened to my father with great attention; there was a seasoning of wisdom unaccountably mixed up with his strangest whims, and he had sometimes such illuminations in the darkest of his eclipses, as almost attoned for them:--- be wary, Sir, when you imitate him.

</p> 
<p>

I am convinced,
<em>Yorick,</em>
continued my father, half reading and half discoursing, that there is a north-west passage to the intellectual world; and that the soul of man has shorter ways of going to work, in furnishing itself with knowledge and instruction, than we generally take with it.


<ps>---But alack! all fields have not a river or a spring running </ps>

besides them;---every child,
<em>Yorick</em>
! has not a parent to point it out.

</p> 
<p>

---The whole entirely depends, added my father, in a low voice, upon the
<em>auxiliary verbs,</em>
Mr.
<em>Yorick</em>
.

</p> 
<p>

Had
<em>Yorick</em>
trod upon
<em>Virgil's</em>
snake, he could not have looked more surprised.


<ps>---I am surprised too, cried my father, observing it,---and I reckon it as one of the greatest calamities which ever befell the republick of letters, That those who have been entrusted with the education of our children, and whose business it was to open their minds, and stock them early with ideas, in order to set the imagination loose upon them, have made so little use of the auxiliary verbs in doing it, as they have done---So that, except </ps>

<em>Raymond Lullius,</em>
and the elder
<em>Pelegrini,</em>
the last of which arrived to such perfection in the use of 'em, with his topics, that in a few lessons, he could teach a young gentleman to discourse with plausibility upon any subject,
<em>pro</em>
and
<em>con,</em>
and to say and write all that could be spoken or written concerning it, without blotting a word, to the admiration of all who beheld him.
</ps>


---I should be glad, said
<em>Yorick,</em>
interrupting my father, to be made to comprehend this matter.

You shall, said my father. 
</p> 
<p>


<ps>The highest stretch of improvement a single word is capable of, is a high metaphor, ---for which, in my opinion, the idea is generally the worse, and not the better;---but be that as it may, </ps>

<br>

<ps>---when the mind has done that, with it ---there is an end,---the mind and the idea are at rest,---until a second idea enters; ---and so on. </ps>


</p> 
<p>

Now the use of the
<em>Auxiliaries</em>
is, at once to set the soul a going by herself upon the materials as they are brought her; and by the versability of this great engine, round which they are twisted, to open new tracks of enquiry, and make every idea engender millions.

You excite my curiosity greatly, said

And these again put negatively,
<em>Is it not?</em>

---Did'st thou ever see a white bear? cried my father, turning his head round to

who stood at the back of his chair:

---No, an' please your honour, replied the corporal.

<strong>When</strong>
my father had danced his white bear backwards and forwards through half a dozen pages, he closed the book for good an' all,---and in a kind of triumph redelivered it into

<strong>When</strong>
the cataplasm was ready, a scruple of
<em>decorum</em>
had unseasonably rose up in
<em>Susannah's</em>
conscience, about holding the candle, whilst

tied it on;
<em>Slop</em>

again.


---Doctor
<em>Slop</em>
clapped his finger and his thumb instantly upon his nostrils;---
<em>Susannah's</em>
spleen was ready to burst at it;--- 'Tis false, said

---Come, come, Mrs. Modesty, said

It was almost impossible for two persons to assist each other in a surgical case with a more splenetic cordiality.

snatched up the candle;--- A little this way, said

;

looking one way, and rowing another, instantly set fire to

wig, which being somewhat bushy and unctuous withal, was burnt out before it was well kindled.

<strong>You</strong>
see 'tis high time, said my father, addressing himself equally to my uncle

to take this young creature out of these women's hands, and put him into those of a private governor.

governors all at once to superintend his son
<em>Commodus's</em>
education,---and in six weeks he cashiered five of them;--- I know very well, continued my father, that

mother was in love with a gladiator at the time of her conception, which accounts for a great many of
<em>Commodus's</em>
cruelties when he became emperor;---but still I am of opinion, that those five whom
<em>Antoninus</em>
dismissed, did
<em>Commodus's</em>
temper in that short time, more hurt than the other nine were able to rectify all their lives long.

Now as I consider the person who is to be about my son, as the mirror in which he is to view himself from morning to night, and by which he is to adjust his looks, his carriage, and perhaps the inmost sentiments of his heart;---I would have one,

<ps>all points, fit for my child to look into. </ps>


---This is very good sense, quoth my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
to himself.

</p> 
<p>

---There is, continued my father, a certain mien and motion of the body and all its parts, both in acting and speaking, which argues a man
<em>well within</em>
: and I am not at all surprized that
<em>Gregory</em>
of
<em>Nazianzum,</em>
upon observing the hasty and untoward gestures of
<em>Julian,</em>
should foretel he would one day become an apostate;---or that St.
<em>Ambrose</em>
should turn his
<em>Amanuensis</em>
out of doors, because of an indecent motion of his head, which went backwards and forwards like a flail;---or that

</p> 
<p>

It is for these reasons, continued my father, that the governor I make choice of shall neither

The Story of

<p>


<ps>

<strong>It</strong>
was some time in the summer of that year in which
<em>Dendermond</em>
was taken by the allies,---which was about seven years before my father came into the country,---and about as many, after the time, that my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
and
<em>Trim</em>
had privately decamped from my father's house in town, in order to lay some of the finest sieges to some of the finest fortified cities in
<em>Europe</em>
---when my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
was one evening getting his supper, with
<em>Trim</em>
sitting behind him at a small sideboard,---I say, sitting---for

<br>

<ps>
in consideration of the corporal's lame knee (which sometimes gave him exquisite pain)---when my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
dined or supped alone, he would never suffer the corporal to stand; and the poor fellow's veneration for his master was such, that, with a proper artillery, my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
could have taken
<em>Dendermond</em>
itself, with less trouble than he was able to gain this point over him; for many a time when my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
supposed the corporal's leg was at rest, he would look back, and detect him standing behind him with the most dutiful respect: this bred more little squabbles betwixt them, than all other causes for five and twenty years together---But this is neither here nor there---why do I mention it?

--- Ask my pen,---it governs me,---I govern not it.

He was one evening sitting thus at his supper, when the landlord of a little inn in the village came into the parlour with an empty phial in his hand, to beg a glass or two of sack; 'Tis for a poor gentleman,---I think, of the army, said the landlord, who has been taken ill at my house four days ago, and has never held up his head since, or had a desire to taste any thing, till just now, that he has a fancy for a glass of sack and a thin toast,---
<em>I think,</em>
says he, taking his hand from his forehead,
<em>it would comfort me</em>
.---

</p> 
<p>
---If I could neither beg, borrow, or buy such a thing,---added the landlord, ---I would almost steal it for the poor gentleman, he is so ill. 
---I hope in God he will still mend, continued he, ---we are all of us concerned for him.

<p>

Thou art a good natured soul, I will answer for thee, cried my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
; and thou shalt drink the poor gentleman's health in a glass of sack thyself, ---and take a couple of bottles with my service, and tell him he is heartily welcome to them, and to a dozen more if they will do him good.

</p> 
<p>

Though I am persuaded, said my uncle
<em>Toby,</em>
as the landlord shut the door, he is a very compassionate fellow---
<em>Trim,</em>
---yet I cannot help entertaining a high opinion of his guest too; there must be something more than common in him, that in so short a time should win so much upon the affections of his host; ---And of his whole family, added the corporal, for they are all concerned for him.

---I have quite forgot it, truly, said the landlord, coming back into the parlour with the corporal,---but I can ask his son again: 

---Has he a son with him then? said my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
.

---A boy, replied the landlord, of about eleven or twelve years of age;---but the poor creature has tasted almost as little as his father; he does nothing but mourn and lament for him night and day: 
---He has not stirred from the bedside these two days.

My uncle

laid down his knife and fork, and thrust his plate from before him, as the landlord gave him the account; and

came in front of his master and made his bow;---my uncle

smoak'd on, and said no more.


---Corporal! said my uncle

---the corporal made his bow.

<em>Toby</em>
proceeded no farther, but finished his pipe.

</p> 
<p>


<em>Trim</em>
! said my uncle
<em>Toby,</em>
I have a project in my head, as it is a bad night, of wrapping myself up warm in my roquelaure, and paying a visit to this poor gentleman.

replied the corporal, has not once been had on, since the night before your honour received your wound, when we mounted guard in the trenches before the gate of St.
<em>Nicholas</em>
;---and besides it is so cold and rainy a night, that what with the roquelaure, and what with the weather, 'twill be enough to give your honour your death, and bring on your honour's torment in your groin.
</ps>


I fear so; replied my uncle
<em>Toby,</em>
but I am not at rest in my mind,
<em>Trim,</em>
since the account the landlord has given me.


---I wish I had not known so much of this affair,---added my uncle
<em>Toby,</em>
---or that I had known more of it:

---How shall we manage it?

said my uncle
<em>Toby,</em>
and here's a shilling for thee to drink with his servant.

---I shall get it all out of him, said the corporal, shutting the door. 
</p> 
<p>

My uncle
<em>Toby</em>
filled his second pipe; and had it not been, that he now and then wandered from the point, with considering whether it was not full as well to have the curtain of the tennaile a straight line, as a crooked one,---he might be said to have thought of nothing else but poor
<em>Le Fever</em>
and his boy the whole time he smoaked it.

<strong>It</strong>
was not till my uncle

had knocked the ashes out of his third pipe, that corporal
<em>Trim</em>
returned from the inn, and gave him the following account.

</p> 
<p>

I despaired at first, said the corporal, of being able to bring back your honour any kind of intelligence concerning the poor sick lieutenant---Is he in the army then? said my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
---He is: said the corporal---And in what regiment? said my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
---I'll tell your honour, replied the corporal, every thing straight forwards, as I learnt it.


<ps>
--- Then
<em>Trim,</em>
I'll fill another pipe, said my uncle
<em>Toby,</em>
and not interrupt thee

<ps>
till thou hast done; so sit down at thy ease,
<em>Trim,</em>
in the window seat, and begin thy story again.
</ps>


The corporal made his old bow, which generally spoke as plain as a bow could speak it---
<em>Your honour is good</em>
:


---And having done that, he sat down, as he was ordered,--- and begun the story to my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
over again in pretty near the same words.

</p> 
<p>


<ps>
I despaired at first, said the corporal, of being able to bring back any intelligence to your honour, about the lieutenant and his son; for when I asked where his servant was, from whom I made myself sure of knowing every thing which was proper to be asked,--- That's a right distinction,

said my uncle

--- If I get better, my dear, said he, as he gave his purse to his son to pay the man, ---we can hire horses from hence. 
--- But alas! the poor gentleman will never get from hence, said the landlady to me, ---for I heard the death-watch all night long;---and when he dies, the youth, his son, will certainly die with him; for he is broken hearted already.

<p>
I was hearing this account, continued the corporal, when the youth came into the kitchen, to order the thin toast the landlord spoke of;---but I will do it for my father myself, said the youth.

sounded in his ears like the name of a friend;---I wish I had him here.

---What could be the matter with me, an' please your honour?

Nothing in the world,
<em>Trim,</em>
said my uncle
<em>Toby,</em>
blowing his nose,---but that thou art a good natured fellow.

</p> 
<p>

When I gave him the toast, continued the corporal, I thought it was proper to tell him I was Captain
<em>Shandy's</em>
servant, and that your honour (though a stranger) was extremely concerned for his father;---and that if there was any thing in your house or cellar---(And thou might'st have added my purse too, said my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
)---he was heartily welcome to it:

---He made a very low bow, (which was meant to your honour) but no answer,---for his heart was full--- so he went up stairs with the toast;---I warrant you, my dear, said I, as I opened the kitchen door, your father will be well again.

When the lieutenant had taken his glass of sack and toast, he felt himself a little revived, and sent down into the kitchen, to let me know, that in about ten minutes he should be glad if I would step up stairs. 
---I believe, said the landlord, he is going to say his prayers,---for there was a book laid upon the chair by his bedside, and as I shut the door, I saw his son take up a cushion.---

---Are you sure of it? replied the curate. 

---A soldier, an' please your reverence, said I, prays as often (of his own accord) as a parson; ---and when he is fighting for his king, and for his own life, and for his honour too, he has the most reason to pray to God, of any one in the whole world---'Twas well said of thee,

said my uncle

<ps>------But when a soldier, said I, an' please your reverence, has been standing for twelve hours together in the trenches, up to his knees in cold water,---or engaged, said I, for months together in long and dangerous marches;---harrassed, perhaps, in his rear to-day;---harrassing others to-morrow; ---detached here;---countermanded </ps>

--- I believe, said I,---for I was piqued, quoth the corporal, for the reputation of the army,---I believe, an't please your reverence, said I, that when a soldier gets time to pray,---he prays as heartily as a parson,---though not with all his fuss and hypocrisy. 

---Thou should'st not have said that,

said my uncle

---for God only knows who is a hypocrite, and who is not:

He did not offer to speak to me, till I had walked up close to his bed-side:

Thou hast left this matter short, said my uncle

to the corporal, as he was putting him to bed,---and I will tell thee in what,

---In the first place, when thou madest an offer of my services to

---as sickness and travelling are both expensive, and thou knowest he was but a poor lieutenant, with a son to subsist as well as himself, out of his pay,---that thou didst not make an offer to him of my purse; because, had he stood in need, thou knowest,

he had been as welcome to it as myself.

right,
<em>Trim,</em>
as a soldier,---but certainly very wrong as a man.
</ps>


</p> 
<p>

In the second place, for which, indeed, thou hast the same excuse, continued my uncle
<em>Toby,</em>
---when thou offeredst him whatever was in my house,---thou shouldst have offered him my house too:


---A sick brother officer should have the best quarters,
<em>Trim,</em>
and if we had him with us,---we could tend and look to him:


---Thou art an excellent nurse thyself,
<em>Trim,</em>
---and what with thy care of him, and the old woman's, and his boy's, and mine together, we might recruit him again at once, and set him upon his legs.---

<strong>I</strong>
Am so impatient to return to my own story, that what remains of young
<em>Le Fever's,</em>
that is, from this turn of his fortune, to the time my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
recommended him for my preceptor, shall be told in a very few words, in the next chapter.

---All that is necessary to be added to this chapter is as follows.--- 
</p> 
<p>

That my uncle
<em>Toby,</em>
with young
<em>Le Fever</em>
in his hand, attended the poor lieutenant, as chief mourners, to his grave.

<p>

That the governor of
<em>Dendermond</em>
paid his obsequies all military honours,---and that
<em>Yorick,</em>
not to be behind hand--- paid him all ecclesiastic---for he buried him in his chancel:


---And it appears likewise, he preached a funeral sermon over him---I say it
<em>appears,</em>
---for it was
<em>Yorick's</em>
custom, which I suppose a general one with those of his profession, on the first leaf of every sermon which he composed, to chronicle down the time, the place, and the occasion of its being preached: to this, he was ever wont to add some short comment or stricture upon the sermon itself, seldom indeed, much to its credit:


<ps>
---For instance,
<em>
This sermon upon the jewish dispensation ---I don't like it at all;---Though I own there is a world of
WATER-LANDISH
knowlege in it,---but 'tis all tritical, and

<em>Moderato,</em>
and the half dozen of
<em>So, so,</em>

There is but one difficulty in the way of this conjecture, which is this, that the
<em>moderato's</em>
are five times better than the
<em>so, so's</em>
;---shew ten times more knowlege of the human heart;---have seventy times more wit and spirit in them;--- (and, to rise properly in my climax)--- discover a thousand times more genius; ---and to crown all, are infinitely more entertaining than those tied up with them; ---for which reason, whene'er
<em>Yorick's dramatick</em>
sermons are offered to the world, though I shall admit but one out of the whole number of the

What

could mean by the words
<em>lentamente,---tenut&egrave;,---grave,</em>
---and sometimes
<em>adagio,</em>

<em>Con strepito</em>
upon the back of another;---
<em>Scicilliana</em>

wrote out very fairly, as if from a hasty copy.

---I take notice of it the more, because it seems to have been his favourite composition ---It is upon mortality; and is tied length-ways and cross-ways with a yarn thrum, and then rolled up and twisted round with a half sheet of dirty blue paper, which seems to have been once the cast cover of a general review, which to this day smells horribly of horse-drugs. 

<ps>---Whether these marks of humiliation were designed,---I something doubt;---because at the end of the sermon, (and not at the beginning </ps>

---Though not very offensively, ---for it is at two inches, at least, and a half's distance from, and below the concluding line of the sermon, at the very extremity of the page, and in that right hand corner of it, which, you know, is generally covered with your thumb; and, to do it justice, it is wrote besides with a crow's quill so faintly in a small
<em>Italian</em>
hand, as scarce to sollicit the eye towards the place, whether your thumb is there or not,---so that from the
<em>manner of it,</em>
it stands half excused; and being wrote moreover with very pale ink, diluted almost to nothing,---'tis more like a

With all these extenuations, I am aware, that in publishing this, I do no service to
<em>Yorick's</em>
character as a modest man;---but all men have their failings! and what lessens this still farther, and almost wipes it away, is this; that the word was struck through sometime afterwards (as appears from a different tint of the ink) with a line quite across it in this manner,

<strong>When</strong>
my uncle

had turned every thing into money, and settled all accounts betwixt the agent of the regiment and
<em>Le Fever,</em>
and betwixt

and all mankind,--- there remained nothing more in my uncle

found little or no opposition from the world in taking administration.

The greatest injury could not have oppressed the heart of

as the best of sons from the best of fathers--- both dropped tears---and as my uncle

gave him his last kiss, he slipped sixty guineas, tied up in an old purse of his father's, in which was his mother's ring, into his hand,---and bid God bless him.

<em>Goths</em>
and
<em>Vandals</em>
did it---or if he can, may it be always for his body's health; and to do it, as my father did it,--- am I sure it would be always for his soul's.

<p>
My way is this:--- 
</p> 
<p>

In all nice and ticklish discussions,--- (of which, heaven knows, there are but too many in my book)---where I find I cannot take a step without the danger of having either their worships or their reverences upon my back--- I write one half
<em>full,</em>
---and t'other
<em>fasting</em>
; ---or write it all full,---and correct it fasting;---or write it fasting,--- and correct it full, for they all come to the same thing:

variation from my father's plan, than my father's from the
<em>Gothick</em>
---I feel myself upon a par with him in his first bed of justice,---and no way inferior to him in his second.

---These different and almost irreconcileable effects, flow uniformly from the wise and wonderful mechanism of nature,---of which---be her's the honour. 
---All that we can do, is to turn and work the machine to the improvement and better manufactory of the arts and sciences.--- 
</p> 
<p>
Now, when I write full,---I write as if I was never to write fasting again as long as I live;---that is, I write free from the cares, as well as the terrors of the world. 
---I count not the number of my scars,---nor does my fancy go forth into dark entries and bye corners to antedate my stabs.

</p> 
<p>
But when, an' please your honours, I indite fasting, 'tis a different history. 
---I pay the world all possible attention and respect,---and have as great a share (whilst it lasts) of that understrapping virtue of discretion, as the best of you. 

---So that betwixt both, I write a careless kind of a civil, nonsensical, good humoured

book, which will do all your hearts good---

<strong>We</strong>
should begin, said my father, turning himself half round in bed, and shifting his pillow a little towards my mother's, as he opened the debate---We should begin to think, Mrs.

of putting this boy into breeches.---

</p> 
<p>
We should so,---said my mother. 
--- We defer it, my dear, quoth my father, shamefully.------ 
</p> 
<p>

I think we do, Mr.

---He does look very well in them, ---replied my mother.--- 
</p> 
<p>
---And for that reason it would be almost a sin, added my father, to take him out of 'em.--- 
</p> 
<p>
---It would so,---said my mother: 
---But indeed he is growing a very tall lad,---rejoin'd my father. 
</p> 
<p>
---He is very tall for his age, indeed, ---said my mother.--- 
</p> 
<p>
---I can not (making two syllables of it) imagine, quoth my father, who the duce he takes after.---

(The dialogue ceased for a moment.)

You are very short, Mr.

</p> 
<p>
Humph! quoth my father to himself, a second time: in muttering which, he plucked his pillow a little further from my mother's,---and turning about again, there was an end of the debate for three minutes and a half. 
</p>

---When he gets these breeches made, cried my father in a higher tone, he'll look like a beast in 'em.

He will be very aukward in them at first, replied my mother.

<p>
---And 'twill be lucky, if that's the worst on't, added my father. 
</p> 
<p>
It will be very lucky, answered my mother.

<p>
I suppose, replied my father,---making some pause first,---he'll be exactly like other people's children.--- 
</p> 
<p>
Exactly, said my mother.---

<p>
---Though I should be sorry for that, added my father: and so the debate stopped again.

They will last him, said my mother, the longest.

He cannot, said my mother.

<p>
'Twere better to have them of fustian, quoth my father.

Nothing can be better, quoth my mother.---

For as

---On the contrary, my father might as well have thought of extracting the seven cardinal virtues out of a long beard, as of extracting a single word out of
<em>Rubenius</em>
upon the subject.

Upon every other article of ancient dress,

informed my father that the

manufactured stuffs of various fabricks,---some plain,---some striped,---others diapered throughout the whole contexture of the wool, with silk and gold------That linen did not begin to be in common use, till towards the declension of the empire, when the
<em>Egyptians</em>
coming to settle amongst them, brought it into vogue.

<ps>birth-days and public rejoicings. </ps>


------ That it appeared from the best historians of those times, that they frequently sent their cloaths to the fuller, to be cleaned and whitened;---but that the inferior people, to avoid that expence, generally wore brown cloaths, and of a something coarser texture,---till towards the beginning of
<em>Augustus's</em>
reign, when the slave dressed like his master, and almost every distinction of habiliment was lost, but the
<em>Latus Clavus</em>
.

</p> 
<p>

And what was the
<em>Latus Clavus</em>
? said my father.

</p> 
<p>


<em>Rubenius</em>
told him, that the point was still litigating amongst the learned:

<em>Egnatius, Sigonius, Bossius Ticinensis, Bayfius, Bud&aelig;us, Salmasius, Lipsius, Lazius, Isaac Causabon,</em>

<em>Scaliger,</em>
all differed from each other,---and he from them:

That some took it to be the button,---some the coat itself,---others only the colour of it:

in his Wardrobe of the ancients, chap. 12.---honestly said, he knew not what it was,---whether a tibula,---a stud,---a button,---a loop,--- a buckle,---or clasps and keepers.------

---My father lost the horse, but not the saddle------They are

said my father---and with hooks and eyes he ordered my breeches to be made.

<strong>If</strong>
the reader has not a clear conception of the rood and a half of ground which lay at the bottom of my uncle
<em>Toby's</em>
kitchen garden, and which was the scene of so many of his delicious hours,---the fault is not in me,---but in his imagination;---for I am sure I gave him so minute a description, I was almost ashamed of it.

</p> 
<p>


<ps>
When
<strong>Fate</strong>
was looking forwards one afternoon, into the great transactions of future times,---and recollected for what purposes, this little plot, by a decree fast bound down in iron, had been destined,

---she gave a nod to
<strong>Nature</strong>
--- 'twas enough---Nature threw half a spade full of her kindliest compost upon it, with just so
<em>much</em>
clay in it, as to retain the forms of angles and indentings,--- and so
<em>little</em>
of it too, as not to cling to the spade, and render works of so much glory, nasty in foul weather.
</ps>


</p> 
<p>

My uncle
<em>Toby</em>
came down, as the reader has been informed, with plans along with him, of almost every fortified town in
<em>Italy</em>
and
<em>Flanders</em>
; so let the Duke of
<em>Marlborough,</em>
or the allies, have set down before what town they pleased, my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
was prepared for them.

</p> 
<p>


<ps>His way, which was the simplest one in the world, was this; as soon as ever a town was invested---(but sooner when </ps>

<ps>the design was known) to take the plan of it, (let it be what town it would) and enlarge it upon a scale to the exact size of his bowling-green; upon the surface of which, by means of a large roll of packthread, and a number of small piquets driven into the ground, at the several angles and redans, he transferred the lines from his paper; then taking the profile of the place, with its works, to determine the depths and slopes of the ditches,---the talus of the glacis, and the precise height of the several banquets, parapets, &amp;c.---he set the corporal to work---and sweetly went it on: </ps>

and the corporal began to run their first parallel.

---I beg I may not be interrupted in my story, by being told,
<em>That the first parallel should be at least three hundred toises distant from the main body of the place,---and that I have not left a single inch for it</em>
;---for my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
took the liberty of incroaching upon his kitchen garden, for the sake of enlarging his works on the bowling-green, and for that reason generally ran his first and second parallels betwixt two rows of his cabbages and his collyflowers; the conveniences and inconveniences of which will be considered

made a lodgment too.

To one who took pleasure in the happy state of others,---there could not have been a greater sight in the world, than, on a post-morning, in which a practicable breach had been made by the duke of
<em>Marlborough,</em>
in the main body of the place,---to have stood behind the horn-beam hedge, and observed the spirit with which my uncle
<em>Toby,</em>
with
<em>Trim</em>
behind him, sallied forth;---the one with the
<em>Gazette</em>
in his hand,---the other with a spade on his shoulder to execute the contents.


---What an honest triumph in my uncle
<em>Toby's</em>
looks as he marched up to the ramparts!

In this track of happiness for many years, without one interruption to it, except now and then when the wind continued to blow due west for a week or ten days together, which detained the

<ps>of either the one or the other of them, adding some new conceit or quirk of improvement to their operations, which always opened fresh springs of delight in carrying them on. </ps>


</p> 
<p>
The first year's campaign was carried on from beginning to end, in the plain and simple method I've related. 
</p> 
<p>

In the second year, in which my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
took
<em>Liege</em>
and
<em>Ruremond,</em>
he thought he might afford the expence of four handsome draw-bridges, two of which I have given an exact description, in the former part of my work.

</p> 
<p>
At the latter end of the same year he added a couple of gates with portcullises: 

<ps>---These last were converted afterwards in orgues, as the better thing; </ps>

<br>

<ps>
and during the winter of the same year, my uncle
<em>Toby,</em>
instead of a new suit of cloaths, which he always had at
<em>Christmas,</em>
treated himself with a handsome sentry-box, to stand at the corner of the bowling-green, betwixt which point and the foot of the glacis, there was left a little kind of an esplanade for him and the corporal to confer and hold councils of war upon.
</ps>


</p> 
<p>
---The sentry-box was in case of rain. 
</p> 
<p>

All these were painted white three times over the ensuing spring, which enabled my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
to take the field with great splendour.

<strong>I</strong>
Must observe, that although in the first year's campaign, the word
<em>town</em>
is often mentioned,---yet there was no town at that time within the polygon; that addition was not made till the summer following the spring in which the bridges and sentry-box were painted,
</ps>


<br>

<small><font color="red">

<br>

<ps>
which was the third year of my uncle
<em>Toby's</em>
campaigns,---when upon his taking
<em>Amberg, Bonn,</em>
and
<em>Rhinberg,</em>
and
<em>Huy</em>
and
<em>Limbourg,</em>
one after another, a thought came into the corporal's head, that to talk of taking so many towns
<em>
without one
TOWN
to show for it,
</em>
---was a very nonsensical way of going to work, and so proposed to my uncle
<em>Toby,</em>
that they should have a little model of a town built for them,---to be run up together of slit deals, and then painted, and clapped within the interior polygon to serve for all.
</ps>


</p> 
<p>

My uncle
<em>Toby</em>
felt the good of the project instantly, and instantly agreed to it, but with the addition of two singular improvements, of which he was almost as proud, as if he had been the original inventor of the project itself.

</p>


<br>
<br>
<small><font color="red">

<br>
<a href="/displayFigure.do?id=tsv6p102.tif"><img style="border:1px solid #000" alt="View Figure" src="/thumbnails/tn_tsv6p102.gif"></a>
<br>

<p>

The one was to have the town built exactly in the stile of those, of which it was most likely to be the representative: ---with grated windows, and the gable ends of the houses, facing the streets, &amp;c. &amp;c.---as those in
<em>Ghent</em>
and
<em>Bruges,</em>
and the rest of the towns in
<em>Brabant</em>
and
<em>Flanders</em>
.

</p> 
<p>
The other was, not to have the houses run up together, as the corporal proposed, but to have every house independant, to hook on, or off, so as form into the plan of whatever town they pleased. 

This was put directly into hand, and many and many a look of mutual congratulation was exchanged between my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
and the corporal, as the carpenter did the work.

<br>

<p>

---It answered prodigiously the next summer---the town was a perfect
<em>Proteus</em>
---It was
<em>Landen,</em>
and
<em>Trerebach,</em>
and
<em>Santvliet,</em>
and
<em>Drusen,</em>
and
<em>Hagenau,</em>
---and then it was
<em>Ostend</em>
and
<em>Menin,</em>
and
<em>Aeth</em>
and
<em>Dendermond</em>
.---

</p> 
<p>

---Surely never did any TOWN act so many parts, since
<em>Sodom</em>
and
<em>Gomorrah,</em>
as my uncle
<em>Toby's</em>
town did.

</p> 
<p>

In the fourth year, my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
thinking a town looked foolishly without a church, added a very fine one with a steeple.


---
<em>Trim</em>
was for having bells in it;---my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
said, the mettle had better be cast into cannon.

</p> 
<p>


<ps>This led the way the next campaign for half a dozen brass field pieces,---to be </ps>

planted three and three on each side of my uncle
<em>Toby's</em>
sentry-box; and in a short time, these led the way for a train of somewhat larger,---and so on---(as must always be the case in hobby-horsical affairs) from pieces of half an inch bore, till it came at last to my father's jack boots.
</ps>


</p> 
<p>


<ps>
The next year, which was that in which
<em>Lisle</em>
was besieged, and at the close of which both
<em>Ghent</em>
and
<em>Bruges</em>
fell into our hands,---my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
was sadly put to it for
<em>proper</em>
ammunition; ---I say proper ammunition---because his great artillery would not bear powder; and 'twas well for the
<em><a href='#Hit155' class='hitmarker' title='View previous hit'><i class="icon-caret-left"></i></a><a name='Hit156'></a><span class="hit">Shandy</span><a href='#Hit157' class='hitmarker' title='View next hit'><i class="icon-caret-right"></i></a></em>
family they would not---For so full were the papers, from the beginning to the end of the siege, of the incessant firings kept up by the besiegers,---and so heated was my uncle

</p> 
<p>


<strong>Something</strong>
therefore was wanting, as a

especially in one or two of the more violent paroxysms of the siege to keep up something like a continual firing in the imagination,--- and this
<em>something,</em>
the corporal, whose principal strength lay in invention, supplied by an entire new system of battering of his own,---without which, this had been objected to by military critics, to the end of the world, as one of the great
<em>desiderata</em>
of my uncle
<em>Toby's</em>
apparatus.

<p>
This will not be explained the worse, for setting off, as I generally do, at a little distance from the subject.

<strong>With</strong>
two or three other trinkets, small in themselves, but of great regard, which poor
<em>Tom,</em>
the corporal's unfortunate brother, had sent him over, with the account of his marriage with the
<em>Jew's</em>
widow---there was

</p> 
<p>

A
<em>Montero</em>
-cap and two
<em>Turkish</em>
tobacco pipes.

</p> 
<p>

The
<em>Montero</em>
-cap I shall describe by and bye.


---The
<em>Turkish</em>
tobacco pipes had nothing particular in them, they were fitted up and ornamented as usual, with flexible tubes of
<em>Morocco</em>
leather and gold wire, and mounted at their ends, the one of them with ivory,---the other with black ebony, tipp'd with silver.

</p>

<br>

<p>
My father, who saw all things in lights different from the rest of the world, would say to the corporal, that he ought to look upon these two presents more as tokens of his brother's nicety, than his affection. 

---
<em>Tom</em>
did not care,
<em>Trim,</em>
he would say, to put on the cap, or to smoak in the tobacco-pipe of a
<em>Jew</em>
.

---God bless your honour, the corporal would say, (giving a strong reason to the contrary)---how can that be.--- 
</p> 
<p>


<ps>
The Montero-cap was scarlet, of a superfine
<em>Spanish</em>
cloth, died in grain, and mounted all round with furr, except about four inches in the front, which was faced with a light blue, slightly embroidered, ---and seemed to have been the property of a
<em>Portuguese</em>
quarter-master,

<br>

<ps>not of foot, but of horse, as the word denotes. </ps>


</p> 
<p>

The corporal was not a little proud of it, as well for its own sake, as the sake of the giver, so seldom or never put it on but upon
<strong>Gala</strong>
-days; and yet never was a Montero-cap put to so many uses; for in all controverted points, whether military or culinary, provided the corporal was sure he was in the right, ---it was either his
<em>oath,</em>
---his
<em>wager,</em>
--- or his
<em>gift</em>
.

</p> 
<p>
---'Twas his gift in the present case. 
</p> 
<p>

I'll be bound, said the corporal, speaking to himself, to
<em>give</em>
away my Montero-cap to the first beggar who comes to the door, if I do not manage this matter to his honour's satisfaction.

The completion was no further off, than the very next morning; which was that of the storm of the counterscarp betwixt the
<em>Lower Deule,</em>
to the right, and the gate St.
<em>Andrew,</em>
---and on the left, between St.
<em>Magdalen's</em>
and the river.

</p> 
<p>

As this was the most memorable attack in the whole war,---the most gallant and obstinate on both sides,---and I must add the most bloody too, for it cost the allies themselves that morning above eleven hundred men,---my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
prepared himself for it with a more than ordinary solemnity.

<ps>
---In assaying to put on his regimental coat and waistcoat, my uncle

found the same objection in his wig,---so that went off too:---so that what with one thing, and what with another, as always falls out when a man is in the most haste,---'twas ten o'clock, which was half an hour later than his

had scarce turned the corner of his yew hedge, which separated his kitchen garden from his bowling green, when he perceived the corporal had began the attack without him.---

Let me stop and give you a picture of the corporal's apparatus; and of the corporal himself in the height of this attack just as it struck my uncle

<strong>The</strong>
corporal, who the night before had resolved in his mind, to supply the grand
<em>desideratum,</em>
of keeping up something like an incessant firing upon the enemy during the heat of the attack,---had no further idea in his fancy at that time, than a contrivance of smoaking tobacco against the town, out of one of my uncle

<strong>The</strong>
corporal had slipped out about ten minutes before my uncle
<em>Toby,</em>
in order to fix his apparatus, and just give the enemy a shot or two before my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
came.

</p> 
<p>

He had drawn the six field-pieces for this end, all close up together in front of my uncle
<em>Toby's</em>
sentry-box, leaving only an interval of about a yard and a half betwixt the three, on the right and left, for the convenience of charging, &amp;c.---and the sake possibly of two batteries, which he might think double the honour of one.

---He held the ivory pipe, appertaining to the battery on the right, betwixt the finger and thumb of his right hand,---and the ebony pipe tipp'd with silver, which appertained to the battery on the left, betwixt the finger and thumb of the other ---and with his right knee fixed firm upon the ground, as if in the front rank of his platoon, was the corporal, with his montero-cap upon his head furiously playing off his two cross batteries at the same time against the counterguard, which faced the counterscarp, where the attack was to be made that morning. 

<ps>
His first intention, as I said, was no more than giving the enemy a single puff or two;---but the pleasure of the

<em>Calais</em>
itself left not a deeper scar in
<em>Mary's</em>
heart, than
<em>Utrecht</em>
upon my uncle
<em>Toby's</em>
.
</ps>


To the end of his life he never could hear
<em>Utrecht</em>
mentioned upon any account whatever,---or so much as read an article of news extracted out of the
<em>Utrecht Gazette,</em>
without fetching a sigh, as if his heart would break in twain.

</p> 
<p>

My father, who was a great MOTIVE-MONGER, and consequently a very dangerous person for a man to sit by, either laughing or crying,---for he generally knew your motive for doing both, much better than you knew it yourself---would always console my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
upon these occasions, in a way, which shewed plainly, he imagined my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
grieved for nothing in the whole affair, so much as the loss of his
<em>hobby-horse</em>
.

---I defy 'em, my dear
<em>Toby,</em>
he would add, to take countries without taking towns,---or towns without sieges.

</p> 
<p>

My uncle
<em>Toby</em>
never took this backstroke of my father's at his hobby horse kindly.

---He thought the stroke ungenerous; and the more so, because in striking the horse, he hit the rider too, and in the most dishonourable part a blow could fall; so that upon these occasions, he always laid down his pipe upon the table with more fire to defend himself than common. 
</p> 
<p>

I told the reader, this time two years, that my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
was not eloquent; and in the very same page gave an instance to the contrary:

<ps>it again. </ps>


---He was not eloquent,---it was not easy to my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
to make long harangues,---and he hated florid ones; but there were occasions where the stream overflowed the man, and ran so counter to its usual course, that in some parts my uncle
<em>Toby,</em>
for a time, was at least equal to
<em>Tertullus</em>
------but in others, in my own opinion, infinitely above him.

</p> 
<p>

My father was so highly pleased with one of these apologetical orations of my uncle
<em>Toby's,</em>
which he had delivered one evening before him and
<em>Yorick,</em>
that he wrote it down before he went to bed.

</p> 
<p>
I have had the good fortune to meet with it amongst my father's papers, with here and there an insertion of his own, betwixt two crooks, thus [ ], and is endorsed,

I may safely say, I have read over this apologetical oration of my uncle

that when a man, whose profession is arms, wishes, as I have done, for war,---it has an ill aspect to the world; ---and that, how just and right soever his motives and intentions may be,---he stands in an uneasy posture in vindicating himself from private views in doing it.

For this cause, if a soldier is a prudent man, which he may be, without being a jot the less brave, he will be sure not to utter his wish in the hearing of an enemy; for say what he will, an enemy will not believe him. 
---He will be cautious of doing it even to a friend,--- lest he may suffer in his esteem: 
---But if his heart is overcharged, and a secret sigh for arms must have its vent, he will reserve it for the ear of a brother, who knows his character to the bottom, and what his true notions, dispositions, and principles of honour are:

</p> 
<p>


<ps>I told him, Sir---for in good truth, when a man is telling a story in the strange way I do mine, he is obliged continually to be going backwards and forwards to keep all tight together in the reader's fancy---which, for my own part, if I did not take heed to do more than at first, there is so much unfixed and equivocal matter starting up, with so many breaks and gaps in it,---and so little service do the stars afford, which, nevertheless, I hang up in some of the darkest passages, knowing that the </ps>

<strong>I</strong>
Told the Christian reader in the beginning of the chapter which preceded my uncle
<em>Toby's</em>
apologetical oration,--- though in a different trope from what I shall make use of now, That the peace of
<em>Utrecht</em>
was within an ace of creating the same shyness betwixt my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
and his hobby-horse, as it did betwixt the queen and the rest of the confederating powers.

</p> 
<p>
There is an indignant way in which a man sometimes dismounts his horse, which as good as says to him, "I'll go afoot, Sir, all the days of my life, before I would ride a single mile upon your back again." 

<ps>
Now my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
could not be said to dismount his horse in this manner; for in strictness of language, he could not be said to dismount

his horse at all---his horse rather flung him------and somewhat
<em>viciously,</em>
which made my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
take it ten times more unkindly.
</ps>

Let this matter be settled by state jockies as they like. 

---It created, I say, a sort of shyness betwixt my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
and his hobby-horse.


---He had no occasion for him from the month of
<em>March</em>
to
<em>November,</em>
which was the summer after the articles were signed, except it was now and then to take a short ride out, just to see that the fortifications and harbour of
<em>Dunkirk</em>
were demolished, according to stipulation.

</p> 
<p>


<ps>
The
<em>French</em>
were so backwards all that summer in setting about that affair, and Monsieur
<em>Tugghe,</em>
the deputy from the magistrates of
<em>Dunkirk,</em>
presented so many affecting petitions to the queen,---beseeching her majesty to cause only her thunderbolts to fall upon the martial works, which

The corporal was for beginning the demolition, by making a breach in the ramparts, or main fortifications of the town---No,---that will never do, corporal, said my uncle

garrison will not be safe in it an hour; because if the

are treacherous ---They are as treacherous as devils, an' please your honour, said the corporal------It gives me concern always when I hear it,

said my uncle
<em>Toby,</em>
---for they don't want personal bravery; and if a breach is made in the ramparts, they may enter it, and make themselves masters of the place when they please:

<ps>they dare. </ps>


---In cases like this, corporal, said my uncle
<em>Toby,</em>
slipping his right hand down to the middle of his cane, and holding it afterwards truncheon-wise, with his forefinger extended, ---'tis no part of the consideration of a commandant, what the enemy dare,--- or what they dare not do; he must act with prudence.


We will begin with the outworks both towards the sea and the land, and particularly with fort
<em>Louis,</em>
the most distant of them all, and demolish it first,---and the rest, one by one, both on our right and left, as we retreat towards the town;---then we'll demolish the mole,---next fill up the harbour, ---then retire into the citadel, and blow it up into the air; and having done that, corporal, we'll embark for
<em>England</em>
.


---We are there, quoth the corporal, recollecting himself---Very true, said my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
---looking at the church.

<strong>A</strong>
Delusive, delicious consultation or two of this kind, betwixt my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
and
<em>Trim,</em>
upon the demolition of
<em>Dunkirk,</em>
---for a moment rallied back the ideas of those pleasures, which were slipping from under him:---still---still all went on heavily---the magic left the mind the weaker---
<strong>Stillness,</strong>
with
<strong>Silence</strong>
at her back, entered the solitary parlour, and drew their gauzy mantle over my uncle
<em>Toby's</em>
head;---and
<strong>Listlessness,</strong>
with her lax fibre and undirected eye, sat quietly down beside him in his arm chair.


---No longer

and
<em>Rhinberg,</em>

and

and
<em>Bonn,</em>
in one year,---and the prospect of
<em>Landen,</em>
and
<em>Trerebach,</em>
and

and

---No more could my uncle

after passing the

lines, as he eat his egg at supper, from thence break into the heart of
<em>France,</em>
---cross over the
<em>Oyes,</em>
and with all
<em>Picardie</em>
open behind him, march up to the gates of
<em>Paris,</em>
and fall asleep with nothing but ideas of glory:


---No more was he to dream, he had fixed the royal standard upon the tower of the
<em>Bastile,</em>
and awake with it streaming in his head.

</p> 
<p>

---Softer visions,---gentler vibrations stole sweetly in upon his slumbers; ---the trumpet of war fell out of his hands,---he took up the lute, sweet instrument! of all others the most delicate! the most difficult!---how wilt thou touch it, my dear uncle

<strong>Now,</strong>
because I have once or twice said, in my inconsiderate way of talking, That I was confident the following memoirs of my uncle
<em>Toby's</em>
courtship of widow
<em>Wadman,</em>
whenever I got time to write them, would turn out one of the most compleat systems, both of the elementary and practical part of love and love-making, that ever was addressed to the world---are you to imagine from thence, that I shall set out with a description of
<em>what love is</em>
? whether part God and part Devil, as

who being a great enemy to blisters, as imagining that half a dozen of 'em on at once, would draw a man as surely to his grave, as a herse and six--- rashly concluded, that the Devil himself was nothing in the world, but one great bouncing

Nor is it to be imagined, for the same reason, I should stop to enquire, whether love is a disease,---or embroil myself with

who always begun with a cooling glyster of hempseed and bruised cucumbers;---and followed on with thin potations of water lillies and purslane---to which he added a pinch of snuff, of the herb

durst venture it,---his topaz ring.

These are disquisitions which my father, who had laid in a great stock of knowledge of this kind, will be very busy with, in the progress of my uncle
<em>Toby's</em>
affairs:


I must anticipate thus much, That from his theories of love, (with which, by the way, he contrived to crucify my uncle
<em>Toby's</em>
mind, almost as much as his amours themselves)---he took a single step into practice;---and by means of a camphorated cerecloth, which he found means to impose upon the taylor for buckram, whilst he was making my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
a new pair of breeches, he produced
<em>Gordonius's</em>
effect upon my uncle
<em>Toby</em>
without the disgrace.

to be added to the anecdote, is this, ---That whatever effect it had upon my uncle

---Not that the phrase is at all to my liking: for to say a man is

in love, ---or that he is
<em>deeply</em>
in love,---or up to the ears in love,---and sometimes even
<em>over head and ears in it,</em>
---carries an idiomatical kind of implication, that love is a thing
<em>below</em>
a man:---this is recurring again to
<em>Plato's</em>
opinion, which, with all his divinityship,---I hold to be damnable and heretical;---and so much for that.

Let love therefore be what it will,--- my uncle

fell into it.

---That she is not a woman of science, my father would say---is her misfortune ---but she might ask a question.--- 
</p> 
<p>
My mother never did. 

---In short, she went out of the world at last without knowing whether it turned

or stood
<em>still</em>
.

---My father had officiously told her above a thousand times which way it was,---but she always forgot.

<p>
For these reasons a discourse seldom went on much further betwixt them, than a proposition,---a reply, and a rejoinder; at the end of which, it generally took breath for a few minutes, (as in the affair of the breeches) and then went on again.

Not a cherry-stone, said my father,--- he may as well batter away his means upon that, as any thing else.

---To be sure, said my mother: so here ended the proposition,---the reply, ---and the rejoinder, I told you of.

It will be some amusement to him, too,---said my father.

A very great one, answered my mother, if he should have children.---

<strong>I</strong>
am now beginning to get fairly into my work; and by the help of a vegetable diet, with a few of the cold seeds, I make no doubt but I shall be able to go on with my uncle
<em>Toby's</em>
story, and my own, in a tolerable straight line.

Now, 
</p>

<p>
These were the four lines I moved in through my first, second, third, and fourth volumes. 
---In the fifth volume I have been very good,---the precise line I have described in it being this:

<ps>
By which it appears, that except at the curve, marked A. where I took a trip to
<em>Navarre,</em>
---and the indented curve B. which is the short airing when I was there with the Lady
<em>Baussiere</em>
and her page,---I have not taken the least frisk of a digression, till
<em>John de la Casse's</em>
devils led me the round you see marked D.---for as for
<em>c c c c c</em>
they are nothing but parentheses, and the common
<em>ins</em>
and
<em>outs</em>
incident to the lives of the greatest ministers of state; and when compared

<br>

<ps>with what men have done,---or with my own transgressions at the letters A B D---they vanish into nothing. </ps>


</p> 
<p>

In this last volume I have done better still---for from the end of
<em>Le Fever's</em>
episode, to the beginning of my uncle
<em>Toby's</em>
campaigns,---I have scarce stepped a yard out of my way.

</p> 
<p>

If I mend at this rate, it is not impossible ---by the good leave of his grace of
<em>Benevento's</em>
devils---but I may arrive hereafter at the excellency of going on even thus;
<br>
--------------------
<br>
which is a line drawn as straight as I could draw it, by a writing-master's ruler, (borrowed for that purpose) turning neither to the right hand or to the left.

------the path-way for Christians to walk in! say divines---

<p>

---The
<em>best line</em>
! say cabbage-planters ---is the shortest line, says
<em>Archimedes,</em>
which can be drawn from one given point to another.---

</p> 
<p>
I wish your ladyships would lay this matter to heart in your next birthday suits! 
</p> 
<p>
---What a journey! 
</p> 
<p>
Pray can you tell me,---that is, without anger, before I write my chapter upon straight lines---by what mistake ---who told them so---or how it has come to pass, that your men of wit and genius have all along confounded this line, with the line of GRAVITATION.

<ps>Now as for my spirits, little have I to lay to their charge---nay so very little (unless the mounting me upon a long stick, and playing the fool with me nineteen hours out of the twenty-four, be accusations) that on the contrary, I have much---much to thank 'em for: cheerily have ye made me tread the path of life with all the burdens of it (except its cares) upon my back; in no one moment of my existence, that I remember, have ye once deserted me, or tinged the objects which came in my way, either with </ps>

Now there is nothing in this world I abominate worse, than to be interrupted in a story---and I was that moment telling Eugenius a most tawdry one in my way, of a nun who fancied herself a shell-fish, and of a monk damn'd for eating a muscle, and was shewing him the grounds and justice of the procedure---

But there is no

Eugenius, replied I, at this rate; for as this

has found out my lodgings---

</p> 
<p>


<ps>---You call him rightly, said Eugenius, ---for by sin, we are told, he enter'd the world---I care not which way he enter'd, quoth I, provided he be not in such a hurry to take me out with him--- for I have forty volumes to write, and forty thousand things to say and do, which no body in the world will say and do for me, except thyself; and as thou </ps>

I will lead him a dance he little thinks of--- for I will gallop, quoth I, without looking once behind me to the banks of the Garonne; and if I hear him clattering at my heels---I'll scamper away to mount Vesuvius---from thence to Joppa, and from Joppa to the world's end, where, if he follows me, I pray God he may break his neck---

Eugenius's wit and affection brought blood into the cheek from whence it had been some months banish'd---'twas a vile moment to bid adieu in; he led me to my chaise---

<strong>It</strong>
is a great inconvenience to a man in a haste, that there are three distinct roads between Calais and Paris, in behalf of which there is so much to be said by the several deputies from the towns which lie along them, that half a day is easily lost in settling which you'll take.

</p> 
<p>
First, the road by Lisle and Arras, which is the most about---but most interesting, and instructing. 
</p>

The second that by Amiens, which you may go, if you would see Chantilly---

"
<strong>Now</strong>
before I quit Calais," a travel-writer would say, "it would not be amiss to give some account of it."---now I think it very much amiss ---that a man cannot go quietly through a town, and let it alone, when it does not meddle with him, but that he must be turning about and drawing his pen at every kennel he crosses over, merely o' my conscience, for the sake of drawing it; because, if we may judge from what has been wrote of these things, by all who have

<strong>Calais,</strong>
Calatium, Calusium, Calesium.

</em>
</p> 
<p>

This town, if we may trust it's archives, the authority of which I see no reason to call in question in this place--- was
<em>once</em>
no more than a small village belonging to one of the first Counts de Guines; and as it boasts at present of no less than fourteen thousand inhabitants, exclusive of four hundred and twenty distinct families in the
<em>bosse ville,</em>
or suburbs ---it must have grown up by little and little, I suppose, to it's present size.

<p>
Though there are four convents, there is but one parochial church in the whole town; I had not an opportunity of taking its exact dimensions, but it is pretty easy to make a tolerable conjecture of 'em--- for as there are fourteen thousand inhabitants in the town, if the church holds them all, it must be considerably large--- and if it will not---'tis a very great pity they have not another---it is built in form of a cross, and dedicated to the Virgin Mary; the steeple which has a spire to it, is placed in the middle of the church, and stands upon four pillars elegant and light enough, but sufficiently strong at the same time---it is decorated with eleven altars, most of which are rather fine than beautiful. 

<ps>The great altar is a masterpiece in its kind; 'tis of white marble, and as I was told near sixty feet high--- </ps>

<br>

<ps>had it been much higher, it had been as high as mount Calvary itself---therefore, I suppose it must be high enough in all conscience. </ps>


</p> 
<p>


<ps>
There was nothing struck me more than the great
<em>Square</em>
; tho' I cannot say 'tis either well paved or well built; but 'tis in the heart of the town, and most of the streets, especially those in that quarter, all terminate in it; could there have been a fountain in all Calais, which it seems there cannot, as such an object would have been a great ornament, it is not to be doubted, but that the inhabitants would have had it in the very centre of this square,---not that it is properly a square, ---because 'tis forty feet longer from east to west, than from north to south; so that the French in general have more

<ps>
reason on their side in calling them
<em>Places</em>
than
<em>Squares,</em>
which strictly speaking, to be sure they are not.
</ps>


</p> 
<p>
The town-house seems to be but a sorry building, and not to be kept in the best repair; otherwise it had been a second great ornament to this place; it answers however its destination, and serves very well for the reception of the magistrates, who assemble in it from time to time; so that 'tis presumable, justice is regularly distributed. 
</p> 
<p>


<ps>
I had heard much of it, but there is nothing at all curious in the
<em>Courgain</em>
; 'tis a distinct quarter of the town inhabitated solely by sailors and fishermen; it consists of a number of small streets, neatly built and mostly of brick; 'tis

<br>

<ps>extremely populous, but as that may be accounted for, from the principles of their diet,---there is nothing curious in that neither. </ps>


---A traveller may see it to satisfy himself---he must not omit however taking notice of
<em>La Tour de Guet,</em>
upon any account; 'tis so called from its particular destination, because in war it serves to discover and give notice of the enemies which approach the place, either by sea or land;---but 'tis monstrous high, and catches the eye so continually, you cannot avoid taking notice of it, if you would.

</p> 
<p>


<ps>It was a singular disappointment to me, that I could not have permission to take an exact survey of the fortifications, which are the strongest in the world, and </ps>

<ps>which, from first to last, that is, from the time they were set about by Philip of France Count of Bologne, to the present war, wherein many reparations were made, have cost (as I learned afterwards from an engineer in Gascony)---above a hundred millions of livres. </ps>


It is very remarkable that at the
<em>T&ecirc;te de Gravelenes,</em>
and where the town is naturally the weakest, they have expended the most money; so that the outworks stretch a great way into the campaign, and consequently occupy a large tract of ground.


<ps>
---However, after all that is
<em>said</em>
and
<em>done,</em>
it must be acknowledged that Calais was never upon any account so considerable from itself, as from its situation, and that easy enterance which it gave our ancestors upon all occasions into France: it was not without its inconveniences

<ps>
also; being no less troublesome to the English in those times, than Dunkirk has been to us, in ours; so that it was deservedly looked upon as the key to both kingdoms, which no doubt is the reason that there have arisen so many contentions who should keep it: of these, the siege of Calais, or rather the blockade (for it was shut up both by land and sea) was the most memorable, as it withstood the efforts of Edward the third a whole year, and was not terminated at last but by famine and extream misery; the gallantry of
<em>Eustace de St. Pierre,</em>
who first offered himself a victim for his fellow citizens, has rank'd his name with heroes.

---But she did not know I was under a vow not to shave my beard till I got to Paris;---yet I hate to make mysteries of nothing;---'tis the cold cautiousness of one of those little souls from which
<em>Lessius (lib. 13. de moribus divinis, cap.</em>
24.) hath made his estimate, wherein he setteth forth, That one Dutch mile, cubically multiplied, will allow room enough, and to spare, for eight hundred thousand millions, which he supposes to be as great a number of souls (counting from the fall of Adam) as can possibly be damn'd to the end of the world.

<p>
From what he has made this second estimate---unless from the parental goodness of God---I don't know---I am much more at a loss what could be in Franciscus Ribbera's head, who pretends that no less a space than one of two hundred Italian miles multiplied into itself, will be sufficient to hold the like number ---he certainly must have gone upon some of the old Roman souls, of which he had read, without reflecting how much, by a gradual and most tabid decline, in a course of eighteen hundred years, they must unavoidably have shrunk, so as to have come, when he wrote, almost to nothing.

And next winter we shall find them less again; so that if we go on from little to less, and from less to nothing, I hesitate not one moment to affirm, that in half a century, at this rate, we shall have no souls at all; which being the period beyond which I doubt likewise of the existence of the Christian faith, 'twill be one advantage that both of 'em will be exactly worn out together---

<strong>The</strong>
French are certainly misunderstood: ---but whether the fault is theirs, in not sufficiently explaining themselves; or speaking with that exact limitation and precision which one would expect on a point of such importance, and which moreover, is so likely to be contested by us---or whether the fault may not be altogether on our side, in not understanding their language always so critically as to know "what they would be at"---I shall not decide; but 'tis evident to me, when they affirm, "
<em>That they who have seen Paris, have seen every thing,</em>
" they must mean to speak of those who have seen it by day-light.

As for candle-light---I give it up--- I have said before, there was no depending upon it---and I repeat it again; but not because the lights and shades are too sharp---or the tints confounded---or that there is neither beauty or keeping, &amp;c. ... for that's not truth---but it is an uncertain light in this respect, That in all the five hundred grand H&ocirc;tels, which they number up to you in Paris---and the five hundred good things, at a modest computation (for 'tis only allowing one good thing to a H&ocirc;tel) which by candlelight are best to be
<em>seen, felt, heard and understood</em>

<strong>The</strong>
abbess of Ando&uuml;illets, which if you look into the large set of provincial maps now publishing at Paris, you will find situated amongst the hills which divide Burgundy from Savoy, being in danger of an
<em>Anchylosis</em>
or stiff joint (the
<em>sinovia</em>
of her knee becoming hard by long matins) and having tried every remedy---first, prayers and thanksgiving; then invocations to all the saints in heaven promiscuously--- then particularly to every saint who had ever had a stiff leg before her---then touching it with all the reliques of the convent, principally with the thigh-bone of the man of Lystra, who had been impotent from his youth---then wrapping

<ps>An old calesh, belonging to the abbesse, lined with green frize, was ordered to be drawn out into the sun---the gardener of the convent being chosen muleteer, led out the two old mules to clip the hair from the rump-ends of their tails, whilst a couple of lay-sisters were busied, the one in darning the lining, and the other in sewing on the shreds of yellow binding, </ps>

The gardener, who I shall now call the muleteer, was a little, hearty, broadset, good natured, chattering, toping kind of a fellow, who troubled his head very little with the
<em>hows</em>
and
<em>whens</em>
of life; so had mortgaged a month of his conventical wages in a borrachio, or leathern cask of wine, which he had disposed behind the calesh, with a large russet coloured riding coat over it, to guard it from the sun; and as the weather was hot, and he, not a niggard of his labours, walking ten times more than he rode---he found more occasions than those of nature, to fall back to the rear of his carriage; till by frequent coming and going, it had so happen'd, that all his wine had leak'd out at the
<em>legal</em>
vent of the borrachio, before one half of the journey was finish'd.

Man is a creature born to habitudes. 
The day had been sultry---the evening was delicious---the wine was generous--- the Burgundian hill on which it grew was steep---a little tempting bush over the door of a cool cottage at the foot of it, hung vibrating in full harmony with the passions---a gentle air rustled distinctly through the leaves---"Come---come, thirsty muleteer---come in."

---The muleteer was a son of Adam. 
I need not say one word more. 

<ps>He gave the mules, each of 'em, a sound lash, and looking in the abbess's and Margarita's faces (as he did it)---as much as to say, "here I am"---he gave a second good crack---as much as to say to his mules, </ps>

By virtue of the muleteer's two last strokes, the mules had gone quietly on, following their own consciences up the hill, till they had conquer'd about one half of it; when the elder of them, a shrewd crafty old devil, at the turn of an angle, giving a side glance, and no muleteer behind them---

<strong>All</strong>
sins whatever, quoth the abbess, turning casuist in the distress they were under, are held by the confessor of our convent to be either mortal or venial: their is no further division.

Now a venial sin being the slightest and least of all sins, ---being halved---by taking, either only the half of it, and leaving the rest---or, by taking it all, and amicably halving it betwixt yourself and another person---in course becomes diluted into no sin at all.

---All you need say of
<em>Fontainbleau</em>
in case you are ask'd) is, that it stands about forty miles (south
<em>something</em>
) from Paris, in the middle of a large forest---That there is something great in it---That the king goes there once, every two or three years, with his whole court, for the pleasure of the chase---and that during that carnival of sporting, any English gentleman of fashion (you need not forget yourself) may be accommodated with a nag or two, to partake of the sport, taking care only not to out-gallop the king---

Though there are two reasons why you need not talk loud of this to every one.

</p> 
<p>
Every thing is very fine, and very rich, and very superb, and very magnificent, said my father, addressing himself to the sacristan, who was a young brother of the order of Benedictines---but our curiosity has led us to see the bodies, of which monsieur Sequier has given the world so exact a description.

</p> 
<p>
Then he has been as great, said my uncle, in the field, as in the cabinet--- I dare say he has been a gallant soldier ---He was a monk---said the sacristan.

</p> 
<p>
---And pray what do you call this gentleman? quoth my father, rather sportingly: 

This tomb, said the young Benedictine, looking downwards, contains the bones of Saint
<strong>Maxima,</strong>
who came from Ravenna on purpose to touch the body---

; replied the young Benedictine, making a bow down to the ground, and uttering the word with so humble, but decisive a cadence, it disarmed my father for a moment.
</ps>

'Tis supposed, continued the Benedictine, that St. Maxima has lain in this tomb four hundred years, and two hundred before her canonization---'Tis but a slow rise, brother Toby, quoth my father, in this self same army of martyrs.

---Poor St. Maxima! said my uncle Toby low to herself, as we turn'd from her tomb: 

She was one of the fairest and most beautiful ladies either of Italy or France, continued the sacristan ---But who the duce has got lain down here, besides her, quoth my father, pointing with his cane to a large tomb as we walked on---It is Saint
<em>Optat,</em>
Sir, answered the sacristan---And properly is Saint Optat plac'd! said my father:

And what is Saint Optat's story? continued he. 

Saint

replied the sacristan, was a bishop---

---I thought so, by heaven! cried my father, interrupting him---Saint Optat!---how should Saint
<em>Optat</em>
fail? so snatching out his pocket-book, and the young Benedictine holding him the torch as he wrote, he set it down as a new prop to his system of christian names, and I will be bold to say, so disinterested was he in the search of truth, that had he found a treasure in St. Optat's tomb, it would not have made him half so rich:

'Twas as successful a short visit as ever was paid to the dead; and so highly was his fancy pleas'd with all that had passed in it,---that he determined at once to stay another day in Auxerre.

on my right-hand, and

on my left, scarce seeing the ancient cities of

What a flame will it rekindle in the lamp, to snatch a blushing grape from the Hermitage and Cot&ecirc; roti, as I shoot by the foot of them? and what a fresh spring in the blood! to behold upon the banks advancing and retiring, the castles of romance, whence courteous knights have whilome rescued the distress'd ---and see vertiginous, the rocks, the mountains, the cataracts, and all the hurry which Nature is in with all her great works about her---

As I went on thus, methought my chaise, the wreck of which look'd stately enough at the first, insensibly grew less and less in its size; the freshness of the painting was no more---the gilding lost its lustre---and the whole affair appeared so poor in my eyes---so sorry!---so contemptible! and, in a word, so much worse than the abbess of Ando&uuml;illet's itself ---that I was just opening my mouth to give it to the devil---when a pert vamping chaise-undertaker, stepping nimbly across the street, demanded if Monsieur would have his chaise refitted---No, no, said I, shaking my head sideways--- Would Monsieur chuse to sell it? rejoin'd the undertaker---With all my soul, said I---the iron work is worth forty livres--- and the glasses worth forty more---and the leather you may take to live on.

For which reason I think myself inexcusable, for blaming Fortune so often as I have done, for pelting me all my life long, like an ungracious dutchess, as I call'd her, with so many small evils: surely if I have any cause to be angry with her, 'tis that she has not sent me great ones---a score of good cursed, bouncing losses, would have been as good as a pension to me.

<strong>To</strong>
those who call vexations,
<strong>Vexations,</strong>
as knowing what they are, there could not be a greater, than to be the best part of a day in Lyons, the most opulent and flourishing city in France, enriched with the most fragments of antiquity---and not be able to see it.


To be withheld upon
<em>any</em>
account, must be a vexation; but to be witheld
<em>by</em>
a vexation---must certainly be, what philosophy justly calls

I had got my two dishes of milk coffee (which by the bye is excellently good for a consumption, but you must boil the milk and coffee together---otherwise 'tis only coffee and milk)---and as it was no more than eight in morning and the boat did not go off till noon, I had time to see enough of Lyons to tire the patience of all the friends I had in the world with it. 
I will take a walk to the cathedral, said I, looking at my list, and see the wonderful mechanism of this great clock of Lippius of Basil, in the first place---

<ps>every thing of that kind, that I solemnly declare I was never yet able to comprehend the principles of motion of a squirrel cage, or a common knife-grinder's wheel---tho' I have many an hour of my life look'd up with great devotion at the one---and stood by with as much patience as any christian ever could do, at the other--- </ps>


</p> 
<p>
I'll go see the surprising movements of this great clock, said I, the very first thing I do: and then I will pay a visit to the great library of the Jesuits, and procure, if possible, a sight of the thirty volumes of the general history of China, wrote (not in the Tartarian) but in the Chinese language, and in the Chinese character too.

<p>
Now I almost know as little of the Chinese language, as I do of the mechanism of Lippius's clock-work; so, why these should have jostled themselves into the two first articles of my list---I leave to the curious as a problem of Nature. 
I own it looks like one of her ladyship's obliquities; and they who court her, are interested in finding out her humour as much as I.

--- at Vienne; I am glad of it, said I, rising briskly from my chair, and walking across the room with strides twice as long as my usual pace---"for so much the sooner shall I be at the

"
</ps>


</p> 
<p>
What was the cause of this movement, and why I took such long strides in uttering this---I might leave to the curious too; but as no principle of clockwork is concern'd in it---'twill be as well for the reader if I explain it myself.

<strong>O!</strong>
There is a sweet &aelig;ra in the life of man, when, (the brain being tender and fibrillous, and more like pap than any thing else)---a story read of two fond lovers, separated from each other by cruel parents, and by still more cruel destiny---

</p>

<br>

<br>Amandus---He
<br>Amanda---She---

<br>Is my Amanda still alive?

<p>
they fly into each others arms, and both drop down dead for joy. 
</p> 
<p>

There is a soft &aelig;ra in every gentle mortal's life, where such a story affords more

to the brain, than all the

and

and

---'Twas all that stuck on the right side of the cullender in my own, of what Spon and others, in their accounts of Lyons, had

into it; and finding, moreover, in some Itinerary, but in what God knows---That sacred to the fidelity of Amandus and Amanda, a tomb was built without the gates, where to this hour, lovers call'd upon them to

attest their truths,---I never could get into a scrape of that kind in my life, but this
<em>tomb of the lovers,</em>
would some how or other, come in at the close---nay such a kind of empire had it establish'd over me, that I could seldom think or speak of Lyons---and sometimes not so much as see even a
<em>Lyons-waistcoat,</em>
but this remnant of antiquity would present itself to my fancy; and I have often said in my wild way of running on---tho' I fear with some irreverence---"I thought this shrine (neglected as it was) as valuable as that of Mecca, and so little short, except in wealth, of the Santa Casa itself, that some time or other, I would go a pilgrimage (though I had no other business at Lyons) on purpose to pay it a visit."

In my list, therefore, of

; so taking a dozen or two of longer strides than usual across my room, just whilst it passed my brain, I walked down calmly into the

in order to sally forth; and having called for my bill---as it was uncertain whether I should return to my inn, I had paid it---had moreover given the maid ten sous, and was just receiving the dernier compliments of Monsieur Le Blanc, for a pleasant voyage down the Rh&ocirc;ne--- when I was stopped at the gate---

<strong>'Twas</strong>
by a poor ass who had just turned in with a couple of large panniers upon his back, to collect eleemosunary turnip tops and cabbage-leaves; and stood dubious, with his two forefeet on the inside of the threshold, and with his two hinder feet towards the street, as not knowing very well whether he was to go in, or no.

</p> 
<p>


<ps>Now, 'tis an animal (be in what hurry I may) I cannot bear to strike---there is a patient endurance of sufferings, wrote so unaffectedly in his looks and carriage, which pleads so mightily for him, that it always disarms me; and to that degree, that I do not like to speak unkindly to him: on the contrary, meet him where I </ps>

<ps>will---whether in town or country---in cart or under panniers---whether in liberty or bondage---I have ever something civil to say to him on my part; and as one word begets another (if he has as little to do as I)---I generally fall into conversation with him; and surely never is my imagination so busy as in framing his responses from the etchings of his countenance---and where those carry me not deep enough---in flying from my own heart into his, and seeing what is natural for an ass to think---as well as a man, upon the occasion. </ps>


In truth, it is the only creature of all the classes of beings below me, with whom I can do this: for parrots, jackdaws, &amp;

others speak by it, and equally make me silent: nay my dog and my cat, though I value them both---(and for my dog he would speak if he could)---yet some how or other, they neither of them possess the talents for conversation---I can make nothing of a discourse with them, beyond the

the
<em>reply,</em>
and
<em>rejoinder,</em>
which terminated my father's and my mother's conversations, in his beds of justice---and those utter'd---there's an end of the dialogue---

</p> 
<p>
---But with an ass, I can commune for ever.

The ass twisted his head round to look up the street---

<p>
Well---replied I---we'll wait a minute for thy driver:

---He turned his head thoughtful about, and looked wistfully the opposite way---

I understand thee perfectly; answered I ---if thou takest a wrong step in this affair, he will cudgel thee to death--- Well! a minute is but a minute, and if it saves a fellow creature a drubbing, it shall not be set down as ill-spent.

---And now thy mouth, if one knew the truth of it, is as bitter, I dare say, as foot---(for he had cast aside the stem) and thou hast not a friend perhaps in all this world, that will give thee a macaroon. 

<ps>
---In saying this, I pull'd out a paper of 'em, which I had just purchased, and gave him one---and at this moment that I am telling it, my heart smites me, that there was more of pleasantry in the conceit, of seeing

an ass would eat a macaroon---than of benevolence

</p> 
<p>
When the ass had eaten his macaroon, I press'd him to come in---the poor beast was heavy loaded---his legs seem'd to tremble under him---he hung rather backwards, and as I pull'd at his halter, it broke short in my hand---he look'd up pensive in my face---"Don't thrash me with it---but if you will, you may" ---If I do, said I, I'll be d---d.

<p>
The word was but one half of it pronounced, like the abbess of Ando&uuml;illet's ---(so there was no sin in it)---when a person coming in, let fall a thundering bastinado upon the poor devil's crupper, which put an end to the ceremony.

I knew the geography of the Tomb of the Lovers, as well as if I had lived twenty years in Lyons, namely, that it was upon the turning of my right hand, just without the gate, leading to the Fauxbourg de Vaise--- I dispatch'd Fran&ccedil;ois to the boat, that I might pay the homage I so long ow'd it, without a witness of my weakness.

<strong>No</strong>
matter how, or in what mood--- but I flew from the tomb of the lovers---or rather I did not fly
<em>from</em>
it--- (for there was no such thing existing) and just got time enough to the boat to save my passage;---and e'er I had sailed a hundred yards, the Rh&ocirc;ne and the Sa&ocirc;n met together, and carried me down merrily betwixt them.

Prithee friend, said I, take hold of my mule for a moment---for I wanted to pull off one of my jack-boots, which hurt my heel---the man was standing quite idle at the door of the inn, and as I had taken it into my head, he was someway concerned about the house or stable, I put the bridle into his hand---so begun with my boot:---when I had finished the affair, I turned about to take the mule from the man, and thank him---

There is nothing more pleasing to a traveller---or more terrible to travel-writers, than a large rich plain; especially if it is without great rivers or bridges; and presents nothing to the eye, but one unvaried picture of plenty: for after they have once told you that 'tis delicious! or delightful!

The second time, I cannot so properly say, I stopp'd---for meeting a couple of Franciscans straiten'd more for time than myself, and not being able to get to the bottom of what I was about---I had turn'd back with them--- 
</p> 
<p>
The third, was an affair of trade with a gossip, for a hand basket of Provence figs for four sous; this would have been transacted at once; but for a case of conscience at the close of it; for when the figs were paid for, it turn'd out, that there were two dozen of eggs cover'd over with vine-leaves at the bottom of the basket---as I had no intention of of buying eggs---I made no sort of claim of them---as for the space they had occupied ---what signified it?

---But it was my intention to have the basket---it was the gossip's intention to keep it, without which, she could do nothing with her eggs---and unless I had the basket, I could do as little with my figs, which were too ripe already, and most of 'em burst at the side: this brought on a short contention, which terminated in sundry proposals, what we should both do---

<strong>I</strong>
Wish my uncle Toby had been a water drinker; for then the thing had been accounted for, That the first moment Widow Wadman saw him, she felt something stirring within her in his favour ---Something!---something.

</p> 
<p>
---Something perhaps more than friendship ---less than love---something---no matter what---no matter where---I would not give a single hair off my mule's tail, and be obliged to pluck it off myself (indeed the villain has not many to spare, and is not a little vicious into the bargain) to be let by your worships into the secret---

But the truth is, my uncle Toby was not a water-drinker; he drank it neither pure nor mix'd, or any how, or any where, except fortuitously upon some advanced posts, where better liquor was not to be had---or during the time he was under cure; when the surgeon telling him it would extend the fibres, and bring them sooner into contact---my uncle Toby drank it for quietness sake. 
</p> 
<p>
Now as all the world knows, that no effect in nature can be produced without a cause and as it is as well known, that my uncle Toby, was neither a weaver--- a gardener, or a gladiator---unless as a captain, you will needs have him one--- but then he was only a captain of foot--- and besides the whole is an equivocation

It was a little stiff and awkward, from a total disuse of it, for the three years he lay confined at my father's house in town; but it was plump and muscular, and in all other respects as good and promising a leg as the other.

<strong>My</strong>
uncle Toby and the corporal had posted down with so much heat and precipitation, to take possession of the spot of ground we have so often spoke of, in order to open their campaign as early as the rest of the allies; that they had forgot one of the most necessary articles of the whole affair; it was neither a pioneer's spade, a pick-ax, or a shovel---

</p> 
<p>


<ps>---It was a bed to lie on: so that as <a href='#Hit187' class='hitmarker' title='View previous hit'><i class="icon-caret-left"></i></a><a name='Hit188'></a><span class="hit">Shandy</span><a href='#Hit189' class='hitmarker' title='View next hit'><i class="icon-caret-right"></i></a> Hall was at that time unfurnished; and the little inn where poor Le Fever died, not yet built; my uncle Toby was constrained to accept of a bed at Mrs. Wadman's, for a night or two, </ps>

There is nothing in it out of doors and in broad day-light, where a woman has a power, physically speaking, of viewing a man in more lights than one--- but here, for her soul, she can see him in no light without mixing something of her own goods and chattels along with him---till by reiterated acts of such combinations, he gets foisted into her inventory---

---And then good night.

Do not speak it with regard to the coarseness or cleanness of them---or the strength of their gussets---but pray do not night-shifts differ from day-shifts as much in this particular, as in any thing else in the world; That they so far exceed the others in length, that when you are laid down in them, they fall almost as much below the feet, as the day-shifts fall short of them?

</p> 
<p>


<ps>Widow Wadman's night-shifts (as was the mode I suppose in King William's and Queen Anne's reigns) were cut however after this fashion; and if the fashion is changed, (for in Italy they are come to nothing)------so much the worse </ps>

The first night, as soon as the corporal had conducted my uncle Toby up stairs, which was about ten---Mrs. Wadman threw herself into her arm chair, and crossing her left knee with her right, which formed a resting-place for her elbow, she reclin'd her cheek upon the palm of her hand, and leaning forwards, ruminated till midnight upon both sides of the question.

---And so to make sure of both systems, Mrs. Wadman predetermined to light my uncle Toby neither at this end or that; but like a prodigal's candle, to light him, if possible, at both ends at once. 
</p> 
<p>


<ps>
Now, through all the lumber rooms of military furniture, including both of horse and foot, from the great arsenal of Venice to the Tower of London (exclusive) if Mrs. Wadman had been rummaging for seven years together, and with Bridget to help her, she could not have found any one

</p> 
<p>


<ps>
I believe I have not told you---but I don't know---possibly I have---be it as it will, 'tis one of the number of those many things, which a man had better do over again, than dispute about it---That whatever town or fortress the corporal was at work upon, during the course of their campaign, my uncle Toby always took care on the inside of his sentry-box, which was towards his left hand, to have a plan of the place, fasten'd up with two or three pins at the top, but loose at the bottom, for the conveniency of holding it up to the eye,
<em>&amp;c....</em>
as occasions required; so that when an attack was resolved upon, Mrs. Wadman had nothing more to do, when she had

<ps>got advanced to the door of the sentry-box, but to extend her right hand; and edging in her left foot at the same movement, to take hold of the map or plan, or upright, or whatever it was, and with outstretched neck meeting it half way, ---to advance it towards her; on which my uncle Toby's passions were sure to catch fire---for he would instantly take hold of the other corner of the map in his left hand, and with the end of his pipe, in the other, begin an explanation. </ps>


</p> 
<p>


<ps>When the attack was advanced to this point;---the world will naturally enter into the reasons of Mrs. Wadman's next stroke of generalship---which was, to take my uncle Toby's tobacco-pipe out of his hand as soon as she possibly could; </ps>

<ps>which, under one pretence or other, but generally that of pointing more distinctly at some redoubt or breast-work in the map, she would effect before my uncle Toby (poor soul!) had well march'd above half a dozen toises with it. </ps>


</p> 
<p>
---It obliged my uncle Toby to make use of his forefinger. 
</p> 
<p>


<ps>The difference it made in the attack was this; That in going upon it, as in the first case, with the end of her forefinger against the end of my uncle Toby's tobacco-pipe, she might have travelled with it, along the lines, from Dan to Beersheba, had my uncle Toby's lines reach'd so far, without any effect: For as there was no arterial or vital heat in the end of the tobacco-pipe, it could excite no sentiment </ps>

<br>

<ps>---it could neither give fire by pulsation---or receive it by sympathy ---'twas nothing but smoak. </ps>


</p> 
<p>
Whereas, in following my uncle Toby's forefinger with hers, close thro' all the little turns and indentings of his works---pressing sometimes against the side of it---then treading upon it's nail---then tripping it up---then touching it here---then there, and so on---it set something at least in motion. 
</p> 
<p>


<ps>This, tho' slight skirmishing, and at a distance from the main body, yet drew on the rest; for here, the map usually falling with the back of it, close to the side of the sentry-box, my uncle Toby, in the simplicity of his soul, would lay his </ps>

<ps>hand flat upon it, in order to go on with his explanation; and Mrs. Wadman, by a manoeuvre as quick as thought, would as certainly place her's close besides it; this at once opened a communication, large enough for any sentiment to pass or repass, which a person skill'd in the elementary and practical part of lovemaking, has occasion for--- </ps>


</p> 
<p>
By bringing up her forefinger parallel (as before) to my uncle Toby's---it unavoidably brought the thumb into action---and the forefinger and thumb being once engaged, as naturally brought in the whole hand.

<strong>These</strong>
attacks of Mrs. Wadman, you will readily conceive to be of different kinds; varying from each other, like the attacks which history is full of, and from the same reasons.


<ps>A general looker on, would scarce allow them to be attacks at all---or if he did, would confound them all together---but I write not to them: it will be time enough to be a little more exact in my descriptions of them, as I come up to them, which will not be for some chapters; having nothing more to add in this, but that in a bundle of original papers and drawings which my father took care to roll up by themselves, there is a plan of </ps>

It has lain there these six weeks, replied the corporal, till this very morning that the old woman kindled the fire with it---

---Then, said my uncle Toby, there is no further occasion for our services. 
The more, an' please your honour, the pity, said the corporal; in uttering which he cast his spade into the wheel-barrow, which was beside him, with an air the most expressive of disconsolation that can be imagined, and was heavily turning about to look for his pick-ax, his pioneer's shovel, his picquets and other little military stores, in order to carry them off the field---when a heigh ho! from the sentry-box, which, being made of thin slit deal, reverberated the sound more sorrowfully to his ear, forbad him.

As the corporal was entering the confines of Bohemia, my uncle Toby obliged him to halt for a single moment; he had set out bare-headed, having since he pull'd off his Montero-cap in the latter end of the last chapter, left it lying beside him on the ground.

<ps>of his story, had my uncle Toby twice touch'd his Montero-cap with the end of his cane, interrogatively---as much as to say, Why don't you put it on, Trim? </ps>

Trim took it up with the most respectful slowness, and casting a glance of humiliation as he did it, upon the embroidery of the fore-part, which being dismally tarnish'd and fray'd moreover in some of the principal leaves and boldest parts of the pattern, he lay'd it down again betwixt his two feet, in order to moralize upon the subject.

of my uncle Toby's reasoning, as much as by the reasoning itself, he has something else to do; if not on action, or a march, or upon duty in his garrison---he has his firelock, an' please your honour, to furbish---his accoutrements to take care of---his regimentals to mend---himself to shave and keep clean, so as to appear always

Trim, said my uncle Toby; for as for geography, 'tis of absolute use to him; he must be acquainted intimately with every country and its boundaries where his profession carries him; he should know every town and city, and village and hamlet, with the canals, the roads, and hollow ways which lead up to them; there is not a river or a rivulet he passes, Trim, but he should be able at first sight to tell thee what is its name---in what mountains it takes its

---As for
<em>Chronology,</em>
I own, Trim, continued my uncle Toby, sitting down again coolly in his sentry-box, that of all others, it seems a science which the soldier might best spare, was it not for the lights which that science must one day give him, in determining the invention of powder; the furious execution of which, renversing every thing like thunder before it, has become a new &aelig;ra to us of military improvements, changing so totally the nature of attacks and defences both by sea and land, and awakening so much art and skill in doing it, that the world cannot be too exact in ascertaining the precise time of its discovery, or too inquisitive, in knowing what great man

<br>

<ps>was the discoverer, and what occasions gave birth to it. </ps>


</p> 
<p>
I am far from controverting, continued my uncle Toby, what historians agree in, that in the year of our Lord 1380, under the reign of Wencelaus, son of Charles the fourth--- a certain priest, whose name was Schwartz, shew'd the use of powder to the Venetians, in their wars against the Genoese; but 'tis certain he was not the first; because if we are to believe Don Pedro the bishop of Leon---How came priests and bishops, an' please your honour, to trouble their heads so much about gun-powder? 

<ps>God knows, said my uncle Toby---his providence brings good out of every thing ---and he avers, in his chronicle of King Alphonsus, who reduced Toledo, That </ps>

<br>

<ps>in the year 1343, which was full thirty seven years before that time, the secret of powder was well known, and employed with success, both by Moors and Christians, not only in their sea-combats, at that period, but in many of their most memorable sieges in Spain and Barbary--- And all the world knows, that Friar Bacon had wrote expressly about it, and had generously given the world a receipt to make it by, above a hundred and fifty years before even Schwartz was born </ps>

--- And that the Chinese, added my uncle Toby, embarass us, and all accounts of it still more, by boasting of the invention some hundreds of years even before him---

---They are some how or other deceived, said my uncle Toby, in this matter, as is plain to me from the present miserable state of military architecture amongst them; which consists of nothing more than a foss&egrave; with a brick wall without flanks---and for what they give us as a bastion at each angle of it, 'tis so barbarously constructed, that it looks for all the world

---Was he

then, Trim? said my uncle Toby, pathetically


---The corporal, wishing first the

and all its synonimas at the devil, forthwith began to run back in his mind, the principal events in the King of Bohemia's story; from every one of which, it appearing that he was the most fortunate man that ever existed in the world--- it put the corporal to a stand: for not caring to retract his epithet---and less, to explain it---and least of all, to twist his tale (like men of lore) to serve a system ---he looked up in my uncle Toby's face for assistance---but seeing it was the very thing, my uncle Toby sat in expectation of himself---after a hum and a haw, he went on---

The King of Bohemia, an' please your honour, replied the corporal, was

throughout the whole kingdom of Bohemia, to be no sea-port town whatever ---

How the duce should there---Trim? cried my uncle Toby; for Bohemia being totally inland, it could have happen'd no otherwise 
---It might; said Trim, if it had pleased God---

My uncle Toby never spoke of the being and natural attributes of God, but with diffidence and hesitation---

<p>
---I believe not, replied my uncle Toby, after some pause---for being inland, as I said, and having Silesia and Moravia to the east; Lusatia and Upper Saxony to the north; Franconia to the west; and Bavaria to the south: Bohemia could not have been propell'd to the sea, without ceasing to be Bohemia---nor could the sea, on the other hand, have come up to Bohemia, without overflowing a great part of Germany, and destroying millions of unfortunate inhabitants who could make no defence against it 
---Scandalous! cried Trim 
---Which would bespeak, added my uncle Toby, mildly, such a want of compassion in him who is the father of it---that, I think, Trim---the thing could have happen'd no way.

The corporal made the bow of unfeigned conviction; and went on.

<p>

Now the King of Bohemia with his queen and courtiers
<em>happening</em>
one fine summer's evening to walk out


---Aye! there the word
<em>happening</em>
is right, Trim, cried my uncle Toby; for the King of Bohemia and his queen might have walk'd out, or let it alone;---'twas a matter of contingency, which might happen, or not, just as chance ordered it.

</p> 
<p>
King William was of an opinion, an' please your honour, quoth Trim, that every thing was predestined for us in this world; insomuch, that he would often say to his soldiers, that "every ball had it's billet."

---It shall never, Trim, be construed otherwise, said my uncle Toby. 
</p> 
<p>
The heart, both of the master and the man, were alike subject to sudden over-flowings; ---a short silence ensued. 
</p> 
<p>
Besides, said the corporal, resuming the discourse---but in a gayer accent---if it had not been for that single shot, I had never, an' please your honour, been in love---

Prithee when? where?---and how came it to pass?

---I dare say, answered Trim, that every drummer and serjeant's son in the regiment knew of it 
---Its high time I should---said my uncle Toby. 
</p> 
<p>


<ps>Your honour remembers with concern, said the corporal, the total rout and confusion of our camp and army at the affair of Landen; every one was left to shift for himself; and if it had not been for the regiments of Wyndham, Lumley, and Galway, which covered the retreat </ps>

---I see him with the knot of his scarfe just shot off, infusing fresh spirits into poor Galway's regiment---riding along the line---then wheeling about, and charging Conti at the head of it

As the number of wounded was prodigious, and no one had time to think of any thing, but his own safety

There is no part of the body, an' please your honour, where a wound occasions more intolerable anguish than upon the knee---

An' please your honour, replied the corporal, the knee, in my opinion, must certainly be the most acute, there being so many tendons and what-d'ye-call-'ems all about it.

<strong>The</strong>

<ps>want of care-taking of me, and a fever I felt coming on besides---(Poor soul! said my uncle Toby) all together, an' please your honour, was more than I could sustain. </ps>


</p> 
<p>
I was telling my sufferings to a young woman at a peasant's house, where our cart, which was the last of the line, had halted; they had help'd me in, and the young woman had taken a cordial out of her pocket and dropp'd it upon some sugar, and seeing it had cheer'd me, she had given it me a second and a third time 

<ps>--- So I was telling her, an' please your honour, the anguish I was in, and was saying it was so intolerable to me, that I had much rather lie down upon the bed, turning my face towards one which was in the corner of the room---and die, </ps>

She was a good soul! as your honour, said the corporal, wiping his eyes, will hear.

I thought

had been a joyous thing, quoth my uncle Toby.

</p> 
<p>
'Tis the most serious thing, an' please your honour (sometimes) that is in the world. 
</p> 
<p>
By the persuasion of the young woman, continued the corporal, the cart with the wounded men set off without me: she had assured them I should expire immediately if I was put into the cart. 

<ps>So when I came to myself---I found myself in a still quiet cottage, with </ps>

<ps>no one but the young woman, and the peasant and his wife. </ps>

I was laid across the bed in the corner of the room, with my wounded leg upon a chair, and the young woman beside me, holding the corner of her handkerchief dipp'd in vinegar to my nose with one hand, and rubbing my temples with the other. 
</p> 
<p>
I took her at first for the daughter of the peasant (for it was no inn)---so had offer'd her a little purse with eighteen florins, which my poor brother Tom (here Trim wip'd his eyes) had sent me as a token, by a recruit, just before he set out for Lisbon---

The young woman call'd the old man and his wife into the room, to shew them the money, in order to gain me credit for a bed and what little necessaries I should want, till I should be in a condition to be got to the hospital 
---Come then! said she, tying up the little purse---I'll be your banker---but as that office alone will not keep me employ'd, I'll be your nurse too.

I thought by her manner of speaking this, as well as by her dress, which I then began to consider more attentively ---that the young woman could not be the daughter of the peasant.

The young Beguine, continued the corporal, had scarce given herself time to tell me "she would be my nurse," when she hastily turned about to begin the office of one, and prepare something for me---and in a short time---though I thought it a long one---she came back with flannels,
<em>&amp;c. &amp;c.</em>
and having fomented my knee soundly for a couple of hours,
<em>&amp;c.</em>
and made me a thin basin of gruel for my supper---she wish'd me rest, and promised to be with me early in the morning.

---She wish'd me, an' please your honour, what was not to be had.

My fever ran very high that night--- her figure made sad disturbance within me 
---I was every moment cutting the world in too---to give her half of it--- and every moment was I crying, That I had nothing but a knapsack and eighteen florins to share with her 
---The whole night long was the fair Beguine, like an angel, close by my bedside, holding back my curtain and offering me cordials---and I was only awakened from my dream by her coming there at the hour promised, and giving them in reality. 

<ps>In truth, she was scarce ever from me, and so accustomed was I to receive life from her hands, that my heart sickened, and I lost colour when she left the room: and yet, continued the corporal, </ps>

---But 'tis no marvel, continued the corporal---seeing my uncle Toby musing upon it---for Love, an' please your honour, is exactly like war, in this; that a soldier, though he has escaped three weeks compleat o'Saturday-night, ---may nevertheless be shot through his heart on Sunday morning

<strong>I</strong>
Had escaped, continued the corporal, all that time from falling in love, and had gone on to the end of the chapter, had it not been predestined otherwise--- there is no resisting our fate.

</p> 
<p>
It was on a Sunday, in the afternoon, as I told your honour--- 
</p> 
<p>
The old man and his wife had walked out--- 
</p> 
<p>
Every thing was still and hush as midnight about the house---

---When the fair Beguine came in to see me. 
</p> 
<p>
My wound was then in a fair way of doing well---the inflammation had been gone off for some time, but it was succeeded with an itching both above and below my knee, so insufferable, that I had not shut my eyes the whole night for it. 
</p> 
<p>
Let me see it, said she, kneeling down upon the ground parallel to my knee, and laying her hand upon the part below it 

<ps>---It only wants rubbing a little, said the Beguine; so covering it with the bed cloaths, she began with the forefinger of her right-hand to rub under my knee, guiding her fore-finger backwards and </ps>

<ps>forwards by the edge of the flannel which kept on the dressing. </ps>


</p> 
<p>
In five or six minutes I felt slightly the end of her second finger---and presently it was laid flat with the other, and she continued rubbing in that way round and round for a good while; it then came into my head, that I should fall in love--- I blush'd when I saw how white a hand she had---I shall never, an' please your honour, behold another hand so white whilst I live--- 
</p> 
<p>
---Not in that place: said my uncle Toby--- 
</p> 
<p>
Though it was the most serious despair in nature to the corporal---he could not forbear smiling.

<p>
The young Beguine, continued the corporal, perceiving it was of great service to me---from rubbing, for some time, with two fingers---proceeded to rub at length, with three---till by little and little she brought down the fourth, and then rubb'd with her whole hand: 
I will never say another word, an' please your honour, upon hands again---but it was softer than satin--- 
</p> 
<p>
---Prithee, Trim, commend it as much as thou wilt, said my uncle Toby; I shall hear thy story with the more delight 
---The corporal thank'd his master most unfeignedly; but having nothing to say upon the Beguine's hand, but the same over again---he proceeded to the effects of it.

The fair Beguine, said the corporal, continued rubbing with her whole hand under my knee---till I fear'd her zeal would weary her 
---"I would do a thousand times more," said she, "for the love of Christ" 
---In saying which she pass'd her hand across the flannel, to the part above my knee, which I had equally complained of, and rubb'd it also. 
</p> 
<p>
I perceived, then, I was beginning to be in love--- 
</p> 
<p>
As she continued rub-rub-rubbing---I felt it spread from under her hand, an' please your honour, to every part of my frame---

<p>

</p> 
<p>
---And then, thou clapped'st it to thy lips, Trim, said my uncle Toby--- and madest a speech. 
</p> 
<p>
Whether the corporal's amour terminated precisely in the way my uncle Toby described it, is not material; it is enough that it contain'd in it the essence of all the love-romances which ever have been wrote since the beginning of the world.

<strong>As</strong>
soon as the corporal had finished the story of his amour---or rather my uncle Toby for him---Mrs. Wadman silently sallied forth from her arbour, replaced the pin in her mob, pass'd the wicker gate, and advanced slowly towards my uncle Toby's sentry-box: the disposition which Trim had made in my uncle Toby's mind, was too favourable a crisis to be let slipp'd---

<p>

Now consider, sir, what nonsense it is, either in fighting, or writing, or any thing else (whether in rhyme to it, or not) which a man has occasion to do--- to act by plan: for if ever Plan, independent of all circumstances, deserved registering in letters of gold (I mean in the archives of Gotham)---it was certainly the

of Mrs. Wadman's attack of my uncle Toby in his sentry-box,

<strong>There</strong>
is nothing shews the characters of my father and my uncle Toby, in a more entertaining light, than their different manner of deportment, under the same accident---for I call not love a misfortune, from a persuasion, that a man's heart is ever the better for it ---Great God! what must my uncle Toby's have been, when 'twas all benignity without it.

<p>
My father, as appears from many of his papers, was very subject to this passion, before he married---but from a little subacid kind of drollish impatience in his nature, whenever it fefell him, he would never submit to it like a christian; but would pish, and huff, and bounce, and kick, and play the Devil, and write the bitterest Philippicks against the eye that ever man wrote---there is one in verse upon some body's eye or other, that for two or three nights together, had put him by his rest; which in his first transport of resentment against it, he begins thus:

In short during the whole paroxism, my father was all abuse and foul language, approaching rather towards malediction ---only he did not do it with as much method as Ernulphus---he was too impetuous; nor with Ernulphus's policy---for tho' my father, with the most intolerant spirit, would curse both this and that, and every thing under heaven, which was either aiding or abetting to his love---yet never concluded his chapter of curses upon it, without cursing himself in at the bargain, as one of the most egregious fools and coxcombs, he would say, that ever was let loose in the world.

<strong>The</strong>
world is ashamed of being virtuous

---My uncle Toby knew little of the world; and therefore when he felt he was in love with widow Wadman, he had no conception that the thing was any more to be made a mystery of, than if Mrs. Wadman, had given him a cut with a gap'd knife across his finger: 
Had it been otherwise---yet as he ever look'd upon Trim as a humble friend; and saw fresh reasons every day of his life, to treat him as such---it would have made no variation in the manner in which he informed him of the affair.

Mrs. Wadman had told it with all its circumstances, to Mrs. Bridget twenty-four hours before; and was at that very moment sitting in council with her, touching some slight misgivings with regard to the issue of the affair, which the Devil, who never lies dead in a ditch, had put into her head---before he would allow half time, to get quietly through her,

---I could like to know---merely for his sake, said Mrs. Wadman---

<strong>If</strong>
any thing in this world, which my father said, could have provoked my uncle Toby, during the time he was in love, it was the perverse use my father was always making of an expression of Hilarion the hermit; who, in speaking of his abstinence, his watchings, flagellations, and other instrumental parts of his religion---would say---tho' with more facetiousness than became an hermit


--- "That they were the means he used, to make his
<em>ass</em>
(meaning his body) leave off kicking."

<br>

<p>

It pleased my father well; it was not only a laconick way of expressing--- but of libelling, at the same time, the desires and appetites of the lower part of us; so that for many years of my father's life, 'twas his constant mode of expression---he never used the word
<em>passions</em>
once---but
<em>ass</em>
always instead of them

---So that he might be said truly, to have been upon the bones, or the back of his own ass, or else of some other man's, during all that time. 
</p> 
<p>

I must here observe to you, the difference betwixt
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My father's ass
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and my hobby-horse---in order to keep characters as separate as may be, in our fancies as we go along.

<p>
For my hobby-horse, if you recollect a little, is no way a vicious beast; he has scarce one hair or lineament of the ass about him 

---'Tis the sporting little filly-folly which carries you out for the the present hour---a maggot, a butterfly, a picture, a fiddle-stick---an uncle Toby's siege---or an
<em>any thing,</em>
which a man makes a shift to get a stride on, to canter it away from the cares and solicitudes of life

--- 'Tis as useful a beast as is in the whole creation---nor do I really see how the world could do without it--- 
</p> 
<p>
---But for my father's ass---oh! mount him---mount him---mount him--- (that's three times, is it not?)---mount him not:---'tis a beast concupiscent---and foul befall the man, who does not hinder him from kicking.

<strong>Well!</strong>
dear brother Toby, said my father, upon his first seeing him after he fell in love---and how goes it with your
<strong>Asse?</strong>


</p> 
<p>


<ps>
Now my uncle Toby thinking more of the
<em>part</em>
where he had had the blister, than of Hilarion's metaphor---and our preconceptions having (you know) as great a power over the sounds of words as the shapes of things, he had imagined, that my father, who was not very ceremonious in his choice of words, had enquired after the part by its proper name; so notwithstanding my mother, doctor Slop, and Mr. Yorick, were sitting in the parlour, he thought it rather civil to

<ps>conform to the term my father had made use of than not. </ps>

When a man is hemm'd in by two indecorums, and must commit one of 'em---I always observe--- let him choose which he will, the world will blame him---so I should not be astonished if it blames my uncle Toby. 
</p> 
<p>
My A---e, quoth my uncle Toby, is much better---brother <a href='#Hit192' class='hitmarker' title='View previous hit'><i class="icon-caret-left"></i></a><a name='Hit193'></a><span class="hit">Shandy</span><a href='#Hit194' class='hitmarker' title='View next hit'><i class="icon-caret-right"></i></a>---My father had formed great expectations from his Asse in this onset; and would have brought him on again; but doctor Slop setting up an intemperate laugh---and my mother crying out L--- bless us!---it drove my father's Asse off the field---and the laugh then becoming general---there was no bringing him back to the charge, for some time---

And so the discourse went on without him. 
</p> 
<p>
Every body, said my mother, says you are in love, brother Toby---and we hope it is true.

<p>
I am as much in love, sister, I believe, replied my uncle Toby, as any man usually is---Humph! said my father--- and when did you know it? quoth my mother---

---When the blister broke; replied my uncle Toby.

My uncle Toby's reply put my father into good temper---so he charged o'foot.

<strong>As</strong>
the antients agree, brother Toby, said my father, that there are two different and distinct kinds of
<em>love,</em>
according to the different parts which are affected by it---the Brain or Liver---I think when a man is in love, it behoves him a little to consider which of the two he is fallen into.

</p> 
<p>
What signifies it, brother <a href='#Hit193' class='hitmarker' title='View previous hit'><i class="icon-caret-left"></i></a><a name='Hit194'></a><span class="hit">Shandy</span><a href='#Hit195' class='hitmarker' title='View next hit'><i class="icon-caret-right"></i></a>, replied my uncle Toby, which of the two it is, provided it will but make a man marry, and love his wife, and get a few children. 
</p> 
<p>

<ps>in my mother's face, as he forced his way betwixt her's and doctor Slop's---a few children! cried my father, repeating my uncle Toby's words as he walk'd to and fro'--- </ps>


</p> 
<p>
---Not, my dear brother Toby, cried my father, recovering himself all at once, and coming close up to the back of my uncle Toby's chair---not that I should be sorry had'st thou a score---on the contrary I should rejoice--and be as kind, Toby, to every one of them as a father--- 
</p> 
<p>
My uncle Toby stole his hand unperceived behind his chair, to give my father's a squeeze--- 
</p> 
<p>


<ps>---Nay, moreover, continued he, keeping hold of my uncle Toby's hand ---so much do'st thou possess, my dear </ps>

<ps>
Toby, of the milk of human nature, and so little of its asperities---'tis piteous the world is not peopled by creatures which resemble thee; and was I an Asiatick monarch, added my father, heating himself with his new project---I would oblige thee, provided it would not impair thy strength---or dry up thy radical moisture too fast---or weaken thy memory or fancy, brother Toby, which these gymnicks inordinately taken, are apt to do--- else, dear Toby, I would procure thee the most beautiful woman in my empire, and I would oblige thee,
<em>nolens, volens,</em>
to beget for me one subject every
<em>month</em>
---
</ps>


</p> 
<p>
As my father pronounced the last word of the sentence---my mother took a pinch of snuff:

<p>

Now I would not, quoth my uncle Toby, get a child,
<em>nolens, volens,</em>
that is, whether I would or no, to please the greatest prince upon earth---

</p> 
<p>
---And 'twould be cruel in me, brother Toby, to compell thee; said my father---but 'tis a case put to shew thee, that it is not thy begetting a child ---in case thou should'st be able---but the system of Love and marriage thou goest upon, which I would set thee right in--- 
</p> 
<p>
There is at least, said Yorick, a great deal of reason and plain sense in captain Shandy's opinion of love; and 'tis amongst the ill spent hours of my life which I have to answer for, that I have read so many flourishing poets and rhetoricians in my time, from whom I never could extract so much---

<p>

I wish, Yorick, said my father, you had read Plato; for there you would have learnt that there are two
<strong>Loves</strong>
--- I know there were two
<strong>Religions,</strong>
replied Yorick, amongst the ancients--- one---for the vulgar, and another for the learned; but I think
<strong>one Love</strong>
might have served both of them very well---

</p> 
<p>

It could not; replied my father---and for the same reasons: for of these Loves, according to Ficinus's comment upon Velasius, the one is
<em>rational</em>
---
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;---the other is
<em>natural</em>
---
<br>
the first ancient---without mother--- where Venus had nothing to do: the second, begotten of Jupiter and Dione---

<ps>not stop to answer, for fear of breaking the thread of his discourse--- </ps>


</p> 
<p>
This latter, continued he, partakes wholly of the nature of Venus. 
</p> 
<p>

The first, which is the golden chain let down from heaven, excites to love heroic, which comprehends in it, and excites to the desire of philosophy and truth--- the second, excites to
<em>desire,</em>
simply---

</p> 
<p>
---I think the procreation of children as beneficial to the world, said Yorick, as the finding out the longitude--- 
</p> 
<p>

---To be sure, said my mother,
<em>love</em>
keeps peace in the world---

</p> 
<p>

---In the

But it keeps heaven empty---my dear; replied my father.

<strong>My</strong>
father had such a skirmishing, cutting kind of a slashing way with him in his disputations, thrusting and ripping, and giving every one a stroke to remember him by in his turn--- that if there were twenty people in company---in less than half an hour he was sure to have every one of 'em against him.

</p> 
<p>


<ps>What did not a little contribute to leave him thus without an ally, was, that if there was any one post more untenable than the rest, he would be sure to throw himself into it; and to do him justice, when he was once there, he would defend </ps>

Doctor Slop's
<strong>Virginity,</strong>
in the close of the last chapter, had got him for once on the right side of the rampart; and he was beginning to blow up all the convents in Christendom about Slop's ears, when corporal Trim came into the parlour to inform my uncle Toby, that his thin scarlet breeches, in which the attack was to be made upon Mrs. Wadman, would not do; for, that the taylor, in ripping them up, in order to turn them, had found they had been turn'd

---Then turn them again, brother, said my father rapidly, for there will be many a turning of 'em yet before all's done in the affair

Then by all means, said my father, bespeak a new pair, brother---for though I know, continued my father, turning himself to the company, that widow Wadman has been deeply in love with my brother Toby for many years, and has used every art and circumvention of woman to outwit him into the same passion, yet now that she has caught him---her fever will be pass'd it's height---

into which a man enters, as my brother Toby would do, into a

---no matter whether he loves the service or no---being once in it---he acts as if he did; and takes every step to shew himself a man of prowesse.
</ps>


</p>

The hypothesis, like the rest of my father's, was plausible enough, and my uncle Toby had but a single word to object to it---in which Trim stood ready to second him---but my father had not drawn his conclusion---

Mrs. Wadman, and no obstacle in nature to forbid the music striking up this very night, yet will I answer for it, that this self-same tune will not be play'd this twelvemonth.

</p> 
<p>
We have taken our measures badly, quoth my uncle Toby, looking up interrogatively in Trim's face. 
</p> 
<p>
I would lay my Montero cap, said Trim 
---Now Trim's Montero-cap, as I once told you, was his constant wager; and having furbish'd it up that very night, in order to go upon the attack--- it made the odds look more considerable 

<ps>---I would lay, an' please your honour, my Montero-cap to a shilling--- </ps>

</p> 
<p>
---There is nothing improper in it, said my father---'tis a mode of expression; for in saying thou would'st lay thy Montero-cap to a shilling---all thou meanest is this---that thou believest--- 
</p> 
<p>
---Now, What do'st thou believe? 
</p> 
<p>
That Widow Wadman, an' please your worship, cannot hold it out ten days---

And whence, cried Slop, jeeringly, hast thou all this knowledge of woman, friend?

Doctor Slop was too much in wrath to listen to the distinction; and my father taking that very crisis to fall in helter-skelter upon the whole order of Nuns and Beguines, a set of silly, fusty baggages 
---Slop could not stand it--- and my uncle Toby having some measures to take about his breeches---and Yorick about his fourth general division ---in order for their several attacks next day---the company broke up: and my father being left alone, and having half an hour upon his hands betwixt that and bed-time; he called for pen, ink, and paper, and wrote my uncle Toby the following letter of instructions.

My dear brother Toby,
<br>

<strong>What</strong>
I am going to say to thee, is upon the nature of women, and of love-making to them; and perhaps it is as well for thee---tho' not so well for me---that thou hast occasion for a letter of instructions upon that head, and that I am able to write it to thee.

</p> 
<p>


<ps>Had it been the good pleasure of him who disposes of our lots---and thou no sufferer by the knowledge, I had been well content that thou should'st have dipp'd the pen this moment into the ink, instead of myself; but that not being the case------Mrs. <a href='#Hit194' class='hitmarker' title='View previous hit'><i class="icon-caret-left"></i></a><a name='Hit195'></a><span class="hit">Shandy</span><a href='#Hit196' class='hitmarker' title='View next hit'><i class="icon-caret-right"></i></a> being now close besides me, preparing for bed--- </ps>

<br>

<ps>I have thrown together without order, and just as they have come into my mind, such hints and documents as I deem may be of use to thee; intending, in this, to give thee a token of my love; not doubting, my dear Toby, of the manner in which it will be accepted. </ps>


</p> 
<p>


<ps>In the first place, with regard to all which concerns religion in the affair--- though I perceive from a glow in my cheek, that I blush as I begin to speak to thee upon the subject, as well knowing, notwithstanding thy unaffected secrecy, how few of its offices thou neglectest ---yet I would remind thee of one (during the continuance of thy courtship) in a particular manner, which I would not have omitted; and that is, never to go forth upon the enterprize, whether it be in the morning or the afternoon, without </ps>

<ps>first recommending thyself to the protection of Almighty God, that he may defend thee from the evil one. </ps>


</p> 
<p>
Shave the whole top of thy crown clean, once at least every four or five days, but oftner if convenient; lest in taking off thy wig before her, thro' absence of mind, she should be able to discover how much has been cut away by Time---how much by Trim. 
</p> 
<p>
---'Twere better to keep ideas of baldness out of her fancy. 
</p> 
<p>
Always carry it in thy mind, and act upon it, as a sure maxim, Toby--- 
</p>

"
<em>That women are timid:</em>
" And 'tis well they are---else there would be no dealing with them.

Let not thy breeches be too tight, or hang too loose about thy thighs, like the trunk-hose of our ancestors.

---A just medium prevents all conclusions.

<p>
Whatever thou hast to say, be it more or less, forget not to utter it in a low soft tone of voice. 
Silence, and whatever approaches it, weaves dreams of midnight secrecy into the brain: For this cause, if thou canst help it, never throw down the tongs and poker.

<ps>Avoid all kinds of pleasantry and facetiousness in thy discourse with her, and do whatever lies in thy power at the same time, to keep from her all books and writings which tend thereto: there are some devotional tracts, which if thou </ps>

---They are all books which excite laughter; and thou knowest, dear Toby, that there is no passion so serious, as lust. 
</p> 
<p>
Stick a pin in the bosom of thy shirt, before thou enterest her parlour. 
</p> 
<p>
And if thou art permitted to sit upon the same sopha with her, and she gives thee occasion to lay thy hand upon hers---beware of taking it---thou can'st not lay thy hand on hers, but she will feel the temper of thine.

Leave that and as many other things as thou canst, quite undetermined; by so doing, thou will have her curiosity on thy side; and if she is not conquer'd by that, and thy

Avicenna, after this, is for having the part anointed with the syrrup of hellebore, using proper evacuations and purges---and I believe rightly. 
But thou must eat little or no goat's flesh, nor red deer---nor even foal's flesh by any means; and carefully abstain--- that is, as much as thou canst, from peacocks, cranes, coots, didappers, and water hens---

Come, my dear, said my father to my mother---'twill be but like a brother and sister, if you and I take a walk down to my brother Toby's---to countenance him in this attack of his.

My uncle Toby and the corporal had been accoutred both some time, when my father and mother enter'd, and the clock striking eleven, were that moment in motion to sally forth---but the account of this is worth more, than to be wove into the fag end of the eighth volume of such a work as this.

<strong>Though</strong>
the Corporal had been as good as his word in putting my uncle Toby's great ramallie-wig into pipes, yet the time was too short to produce any great effects from it: it had lain many years squeezed up in the corner of his old campaign trunk; and as bad forms are not so easy to be got the better of, and the use of candle-ends not so well understood, it was not so pliable a business as one would have wished.


<ps>The Corporal with cheary eye and both arms extended, had fallen back perpendicular from it a score times, to inspire it, if possible, with a better air---had SPLEEN given a look at it, </ps>

Such it was---or rather such would it have seem'd upon any other brow; but the sweet look of goodness which sat upon my uncle Toby's, assimulated every thing around it so sovereignly to itself, and Nature had moreover wrote
<strong>Gentleman</strong>
with so fair a hand in every line of his countenance, that even his tarnish'd gold-laced hat and huge cockade of flimsy taffeta became him; and though not worth a button in themselves, yet the moment my uncle Toby put them on, they became serious objects,

Nothing in this world could have cooperated more powerfully towards this, than my uncle Toby's blue and gold---

<strong>My</strong>
uncle Toby turn'd his head more than once behind him, to see how he was supported by the Corporal; and the Corporal as oft as he did it, gave a slight flourish with his stick--- but not vapouringly; and with the sweetest accent of most respectful encouragement, bid his honour "never fear."

Tom's place, an' please your honour, was easy---and the weather warm---it put him upon thinking seriously of settling himself in the world; and as it fell out about that time, that a Jew who kept a sausage shop in the same street, had the ill luck to die of a strangury, and leave his widow in possession of a rousing trade---Tom thought (as every body in Lisbon was doing the best he could devise for himself) there could be no harm in offering her his service to carry it on: so without any introduction to the widow, except that of buying a pound of sausages at her shop---Tom set out---counting the matter thus within

<p>


<ps>It was owing to the neglect of that very precaution, said my uncle Toby, laying his hand upon Trim's shoulder, That Count de la Motte lost the battle of Wynendale: he pressed too speedily into the wood; which if he had not done, Lisle had not fallen into our hands, nor Ghent and Bruges, which both followed </ps>

</p> 
<p>
---Why therefore, may not battles, an' please your honour, as well as marriages, be made in heaven? 
---My uncle Toby mused.--- 
</p> 
<p>
Religion inclined him to say one thing, and his high idea of military skill tempted him to say another; so not being able to frame a reply exactly to his mind ---my uncle Toby said nothing at all; and the Corporal finished his story.

As Tom perceived, an' please your honour, that he gained ground, and that all he had said upon the subject of sausages was kindly taken, he went on to help her a little in making them. 
--- First, by taking hold of the ring of the sausage whilst she stroked the forced meat down with her hand---then by cutting the strings into proper lengths, and holding them in his hand, whilst she took them out one by one---then, by putting them across her mouth, that she might take them out as she wanted them---and so on from little to more, till at last he adventured to tie the sausage himself, whilst she held the snout.---

She made a feint however of defending herself, by snatching up a sausage:

But seeing Tom's had more gristle in it---

She signed the capitulation---and Tom sealed it; and there was an end of the matter.

I hope, Trim, answered my uncle Toby, I love mankind more than either; and as the knowledge of arms tends so apparently to the good and quiet of the world---and particularly that branch of it which we have practised together in our bowling-green, has no object but to shorten the strides of
<strong>Ambition,</strong>
and intrench the lives and fortunes of the
<em>few,</em>
from the plunderings of the
<em>many</em>
---whenever that drum beats in our ears, I trust, Corporal, we shall neither of us want so much humanity and fellow-feeling as to face about and march.

</p> 
<p>


<ps>In pronouncing this, my uncle Toby faced about, and march'd firmly as at the head of his company---and the faithful Corporal, shouldering his stick, </ps>

<strong>My</strong>
mother had gone with her left arm twisted in my father's right, till they had got to the fatal angle of the old garden wall, where Doctor Slop was overthrown by Obadiah on the coach-horse: as this was directly opposite to the front of Mrs. Wadman's house, when my father came to it, he gave a look across; and seeing my uncle Toby and the Corporal within ten paces of the door, he turn'd about---"Let us just stop a moment, quoth my father, and see with what ceremonies my brother Toby and his man Trim make their first entry---it will not detain

The Corporal was just then setting in with the story of his brother Tom and the Jew's widow: the story went on--- and on---it had episodes in it--- it came back, and went on---and on again; there was no end of it---the reader found it very long---

When issues of events like these my father is waiting for, are hanging in the scales of fate, the mind has the advantage of changing the principle of expectation three times, without which it would not have power to see it out.

Curiosity governs the

My father stood it out as well as he could with these three auxiliaries to the end of Trim's story; and from thence to the end of my uncle Toby's panegyrick upon arms, in the chapter following it; when seeing, that instead of marching up to Mrs. Wadman's door, they both faced about and march'd down the avenue diametrically opposite to his expectation ---he broke out at once with that little subacid soreness of humour which, in certain situations, distinguished his character from that of all other men.

Now she had a way, which by the bye, I would this moment give away my purple jerkin, and my yellow slippers into the bargain, if some of your reverences would imitate---and that was never to refuse her assent and consent to any proposition my father laid before her, merely because she did not understand it, or had no ideas to the principal word or term of art, upon which the tenet or proposition rolled. 
She contented herself with doing all that her godfathers and godmothers promised for her---but no more; and so would go on using a hard word twenty years together---and replying to it too, if it was a verb, in all its moods and tenses, without giving herself any trouble to enquire about it.

<strong>Upon</strong>
looking back from the end of the last chapter and surveying the texture of what has been wrote, it is necessary, that upon this page and the five following, a good quantity of heterogeneous matter be inserted, to keep up that just balance betwixt wisdom and folly, without which a book would not hold together a single year: nor is it a poor creeping digression (which but for the name of, a man might continue as well going on in the king's highway) which will do the business---no; if it is to be a digression, it must be a good frisky one, and upon a frisky subject too, where neither the horse or his rider are to be caught, but by rebound.

<br>

<p>
The only difficulty, is raising powers suitable to the nature of the service: 

<strong>Fancy</strong>
is capricious---
<strong>Wit</strong>
must not be searched for---and
<strong>Pleasantry</strong>
(good-natured slut as she is) will not come in at a call, was an empire to be laid at her feet.

</p> 
<p>
---The best way for a man, is to say his prayers--- 
</p> 
<p>
Only if it puts him in mind of his infirmities and defects as well ghostly as bodily---for that purpose, he will find himself rather worse after he has said them than before---for other purposes, better. 
</p>

<ps>that I could think of, which I have not taken with myself in this case: sometimes by addressing myself directly to the soul herself, and arguing the point over and over again with her upon the extent of her own faculties--- </ps>


</p> 
<p>
---I never could make them an inch the wider--- 
</p> 
<p>
Then by changing my system, and trying what could be made of it upon the body, by temperance, soberness and chastity: 
These are good, quoth I, in themselves ---they are good, absolutely;---they are good, relatively;---they are good for health---they are good for happiness in this world---they are good for happiness in the next---

<p>
In short, they were good for every thing but the thing wanted; and there they were good for nothing, but to leave the soul just as heaven made it: as for the theological virtues of faith and hope, they give it courage; but then that sniveling virtue of Meekness (as my father would always call it) takes it quite away again, so you are exactly where you started. 
</p> 
<p>
Now in all common and ordinary cases, there is nothing which I have found to answer so well as this--- 
</p> 
<p>


<ps>---Certainly, if there is any dependence upon Logic, and that I am not blinded by self-love, there must be something of true genius about me, merely upon this symptom of it, that I do not know what envy is: for never do </ps>

To this, I have no other answer--- at least ready------but that the Archbishop of Benevento wrote his

Romance of the Galatea, as all the world knows, in a purple coat, waistcoat, and purple pair of breeches; and that the penance set him of writing a commentary upon the book of the Revelations, as severe as it was look'd upon by one part of the world, was far from being deem'd so, by the other, upon the single account of that

fifteenth chapter is come at last; and brings nothing with it but a sad signature of "How our pleasures slip from under us in this world;"

For in talking of my digression--- I declare before heaven I have made it! 
What a strange creature is mortal man! said she.

'Tis very true, said I---but 'twere better to get all these things out of our heads, and return to my uncle Toby.

<strong>When</strong>
my uncle Toby and the Corporal had marched down to the bottom of the avenue, they recollected their business lay the other way; so they faced about and marched up streight to Mrs. Wadman's door.

</p> 
<p>


<ps>I warrant your honour; said the Corporal, touching his Montero-cap with his hand, as he passed him in order to give a knock at the door---My uncle Toby, contrary to his invariable way of treating his faithful servant, said nothing good or bad: the truth was, he had not altogether marshal'd his ideas; he wish'd for another conference, and as the Corporal </ps>

<ps>was mounting up the three steps before the door---he hem'd twice---a portion of my uncle Toby's most modest spirits fled, at each expulsion, towards the Corporal; he stood with the rapper of the door suspended for a full minute in his hand, he scarce knew why. </ps>

Bridget stood perdue within, with her finger and her thumb upon the latch, benumb'd with expectation; and Mrs. Wadman, with an eye ready to be deflowered again, sat breathless behind the window-curtain of her bed-chamber, watching their approach. 
</p> 
<p>
Trim! said my uncle Toby---but as he articulated the word, the minute expired, and Trim let fall the rapper.

<strong>As</strong>
Mrs. Bridget's finger and thumb were upon the latch, the Corporal did not knock as oft as perchance your honour's taylor---I might have taken my example something nearer home; for I owe mine, some five and twenty pounds at least, and wonder at the man's patience---

---You shall see the very place, Madam; said my uncle Toby.

Mrs. Wadman blush'd---look'd towards the door---turn'd pale--- blush'd slightly again---recovered her natural colour---blush'd worse than ever; which for the sake of the unlearned reader, I translate thus---

Whilst all this was running through Mrs. Wadman's imagination, my uncle Toby had risen from the sopha, and got to the other side of the parlour-door, to give Trim an order about it in the passage---

The Corporal did not approve of the orders, but most chearfully obey'd them. 
The first was not an act of his will---the second was; so he put on his Montero cap, and went as fast as his lame knee would let him. 
My uncle Toby returned into the parlour, and sat himself down again upon the sopha.

<p>
---You shall lay your finger upon the place---said my uncle Toby. 
---I will not touch it, however, quoth Mrs. Wadman to herself.

<strong>As</strong>
there are fifty different ends (counting all ends in---as well civil as religious) for which a woman takes a husband, she first sets about and carefully weighs, then separates and distinguishes in her mind, which of all that number of ends, is hers: then by discourse, enquiry, argumentation and inference, she investigates and finds out whether she has got hold of the right one---and if she has---then, by pulling it gently this way and that way, she further forms a judgment, whether it will not break in the drawing.

Now this last article was somewhat apocryphal; and the Devil, who is the great disturber of our faiths in this world, had raised scruples in Mrs. Wadman's brain about it; and like a true devil as he was, had done his own work at the same time, by turning my uncle Toby's Virtue thereupon into nothing but

? said I.

<p>

The love and pity of all the villages around us; said the postillion---it is but three years ago, that the sun did not shine upon so fair, so quick-witted and amiable a maid; and better fate did
<em>Maria</em>
deserve, than to have her Banns forbid, by the intrigues of the curate of the parish who published them---

<ps>---they were the same notes;---yet were ten times sweeter: </ps>


It is the evening service to the Virgin, said the young man---but who has taught her to play it---or how she came by her pipe, no one knows; we think that Heaven has assisted her in both; for ever since she has been unsettled in her mind, it seems her only consolation---she has never once had the pipe out of her hand, but plays that
<em>service</em>
upon it almost night and day.

</p> 
<p>


<ps>The postillion delivered this with so much discretion and natural eloquence, that I could not help decyphering something in his face above his condition, and should have sifted out his history, </ps>

<ps>had not poor Maria's taken such full possession of me. </ps>


</p> 
<p>
We had got up by this time almost to the bank where Maria was sitting: she was in a thin white jacket with her hair, all but two tresses, drawn up into a silk net, with a few olive leaves twisted a little fantastically on one side---she was beautiful; and if ever I felt the full force of an honest heart-ache, it was the moment I saw her--- 
</p> 
<p>


<ps>---God help her! poor damsel! above a hundred masses, said the postillion, have been said in the several parish churches and convents around, for her, ---but without effect; we have still hopes, as she is sensible for short intervals, </ps>

<br>

<ps>that the Virgin at last will restore her to herself; but her parents, who know her best, are hopeless upon that score, and think her senses are lost for ever. </ps>


</p> 
<p>

As the postillion spoke this,
<strong>Maria</strong>
made a cadence so melancholy, so tender and querulous, that I sprung out of the chaise to help her, and found myself sitting betwixt her and her goat before I relapsed from my enthusiasm.

</p> 
<p>


<strong>Maria</strong>
look'd wistfully for some time at me, and then at her goat---and then at me---and then at her goat again, and so on, alternately---

</p> 
<p>
---Well, Maria, said I softly--- What resemblance do you find?

<p>

I do intreat the candid reader to believe me, that it was from the humblest conviction of what a
<em>Beast</em>
man is,---that I ask'd the question; and that I would not have let fallen an unseasonable pleasantry in the venerable presence of Misery, to be entitled to all the wit that ever Rabelais scatter'd---and yet I own my heart smote me, and that I so smarted at the very idea of it, that I swore I would set up for Wisdom and utter grave sentences the rest of my days---and never--- never attempt again to commit mirth with man, woman, or child, the longest day I had to live.

</p> 
<p>
As for writing nonsense to them--- I believe, there was a reserve---but that I leave to the world.

Adieu, Maria!---adieu, poor hapless damsel!---some time, but not
<em>now,</em>
I may hear thy sorrows from thy own lips ---but I was deceived; for that moment she took her pipe and told me such a tale of woe with it, that I rose up, and with broken and irregular steps walk'd softly to my chaise.

---What an excellent inn at Moulins!

The Eighteenth Chapter.

<p>


<strong>As</strong>
Mrs. Bridget open'd the door before the Corporal had well given the rap, the interval betwixt that and my uncle Toby's introduction into the parlour, was so short, that Mrs. Wadman had but just time to get from behind the curtain---lay a Bible upon the table, and advance a step or two towards the door to receive him.

</p> 
<p>


<ps>My uncle Toby saluted Mrs. Wadman, after the manner in which women were saluted by men in the year of our Lord God one thousand seven hundred and thirteen---then facing about, he march'd up abreast with her to the </ps>

<ps>
sopha, and in three plain words------ though not before he was sat down--- nor after he was sat down--- but as he was sitting down, told her, "
<em>he was in love</em>
"---so that my uncle Toby strained himself more in the declaration than he needed.
</ps>


</p> 
<p>

Mrs. Wadman naturally looked down, upon a slit she had been darning up in her apron, in expectation every moment, that my uncle Toby would go on; but having no talents for amplification, and
<strong>Love</strong>
moreover of all others being a subject of which he was the least a master ---When he had told Mrs. Wadman once that he loved her, he let it alone, and left the matter to work after its own way.

<br>

<p>
My father was always in raptures with this system of my uncle Toby's, as he falsely called it, and would often say, that could his brother Toby to his processe have added but a pipe of tobacco--- he had wherewithal to have found his way, if there was faith in a Spanish proverb, towards the hearts of half the women upon the globe. 
</p> 
<p>

My uncle Toby never understood what my father meant; nor will I presume to extract more from it, than a condemnation of an error which the bulk of the world lie under---but the French, every one of 'em to a man, who believe in it, almost as much as the REAL PRESENCE, "
<em>That talking of love, is making it</em>
."

---I would as soon set about making a black-pudding by the same receipt. 
</p> 
<p>
Let us go on: 
Mrs. Wadman sat in expectation my uncle Toby would do so, to almost the first pulsation of that minute, wherein silence on one side or the other, generally becomes indecent: so edging herself a little more towards him, and raising up her eyes, sub-blushing, as she did it---she took up the gauntlet ---or the discourse (if you like it better) and communed with my uncle Toby, thus. 
</p> 
<p>

</p> 
<p>
---They are written, quoth my uncle Toby, in the Common-Prayer Book. 
</p> 
<p>
Thus far my uncle Toby went on warily, and kept within his depth, leaving Mrs. Wadman to sail upon the gulph as she pleased. 
</p> 
<p>


<ps>---As for children---said Mrs. Wadman ---though a principal end perhaps of the institution, and the natural wish, I suppose, of every parent---yet do not we all find, they are certain sorrows, and very </ps>

<ps>uncertain comforts? and what is there, dear sir, to pay one for the heart-achs--- what compensation for the many tender and disquieting apprehensions of a suffering and defenceless mother who brings them into life? </ps>

<strong>Now</strong>
there are such an infinitude of notes, tunes, cants, chants, airs, looks, and accents with which the word
<em>fiddlestick</em>
may be pronounced in all such causes as this, every one of 'em impressing a sense and meaning as different from the other, as

from

Mrs. Wadman hit upon the

which summoned up all my uncle Toby's modest blood into his cheeks---so feeling within himself that he had somehow or other got beyond his depth, he stopt

<ps>short; and without entering further either into the pains or pleasures of matrimony, he laid his hand upon his heart, and made an offer to take them as they were, and share them along with her. </ps>


</p> 
<p>
When my uncle Toby had said this, he did not care to say it again; so casting his eye upon the Bible which Mrs. Wadman had laid upon the table, he took it up; and popping, dear soul! upon a passage in it, of all others the most interesting to him---which was the siege of Jericho---he set himself to read it over---leaving his proposal of marriage, as he had done his declaration of love, to work with her after its own way.

<strong>It</strong>
is natural for a perfect stranger who is going from London to Edinburgh, to enquire before he sets out, how many miles to York; which is about the half way---nor does any body wonder, if he goes on and asks about the Corporation, &amp;c.--

</p> 
<p>
It was just as natural for Mrs. Wadman, whose first husband was all his time afflicted with a Sciatica, to wish to know how far from the hip to the groin; and how far she was likely to suffer more or less in her feelings, in the one case than in the other. 
</p>

She had accordingly read
<em>Drake's</em>
anatomy from one end to the other.

She had reason'd likewise from her own powers---laid down theorems ---drawn consequences, and come to no conclusion.

To clear up all, she had twice asked Doctor Slop, "if poor captain <a href='#Hit204' class='hitmarker' title='View previous hit'><i class="icon-caret-left"></i></a><a name='Hit205'></a><span class="hit">Shandy</span><a href='#Hit206' class='hitmarker' title='View next hit'><i class="icon-caret-right"></i></a> was ever likely to recover of his wound---?"

What! quite?

<p>
---Quite: madam---

<p>
But what do you mean by a recovery? 
Mrs. Wadman would say.

<p>
Doctor Slop was the worst man alive at definitions; and so Mrs. Wadman could get no knowledge: in short, there was no way to extract it, but from my uncle Toby himself.

There is an accent of humanity in an enquiry of this kind which lulls
<strong>Suspicion</strong>
to rest------and I am half persuaded the serpent got pretty near it, in his discourse with Eve; for the propensity in the sex to be deceived could not be so great, that she should have boldness to hold chat with the devil, without it---

<strong>It</strong>
was like the momentary contest in the moist eye-lids of an April morning, "Whether Bridget should laugh or cry."

</p> 
<p>
She snatch'd up a rolling-pin--- 'twas ten to one, she had laugh'd--- 
</p> 
<p>

She laid it down---she cried; and had one single tear of 'em but tasted of bitterness, full sorrowful would the Corporal's heart have been that he had used the argument; but the Corporal understood the sex, a
<em>quart major to a terce</em>
at least, better than my uncle Toby, and accordingly he assailed Mrs. Bridget after this manner.

I know, Mrs. Bridget, said the Corporal, giving her a most respectful kiss, that thou art good and modest by nature, and art withal so generous a girl in thyself, that if I know thee rightly, thou wouldst not wound an insect, much less the honour of so gallant and worthy a soul as my master, wast thou sure to be made a countess of---but thou hast been set on, and deluded, dear Bridget, as is often a woman's case, "to please others more than themselves---"

<strong>My</strong>
uncle Toby and the Corporal had gone on separately with their operations the greatest part of the campaign, and as effectually cut off from all communication of what either the one or the other had been doing, as if they had been separated from each other by the
<em>Maes</em>
or the
<em>Sambre</em>
.

</p> 
<p>
My uncle Toby, on his side, had presented himself every afternoon in his red and silver, and blue and gold alternately, and sustained an infinity of attacks in them, without knowing them to be attacks ---and so had nothing to communicate---

<p>
The Corporal, on his side, in taking Bridget, by it had gain'd considerable advantages------and consequently had much to communicate---but what were the advantages---as well, as what was the manner by which he had seiz'd them, required so nice an historian that the Corporal durst not venture upon it; and as sensible as he was of glory, would rather have been contented to have gone barehead and without laurels for ever, than torture his master's modesty for a single moment---

<p>
---Best of honest and gallant servants!

<strong>Now</strong>
my uncle Toby had one evening laid down his pipe upon the table, and was counting over to himself upon his finger ends, (beginning at his thumb) all Mrs. Wadman's perfections one by one; and happening two or three times together, either by omitting some, or counting others twice over to puzzle himself sadly before he could get beyond his middle finger---Prithee, Trim! said he, taking up his pipe again,---bring me a pen and ink: Trim brought paper also.

Take a full sheet---Trim! said my uncle Toby, making a sign with his pipe at the same time to take a chair and sit down close by him at the table. 
The Corporal obeyed---placed the paper directly before him---took a pen and dip'd it in the ink.

---She has a thousand virtues, Trim! said my uncle Toby---

<p>
Am I to set them down, an' please your honour? quoth the Corporal.

<p>

The Corporal made no reply to my uncle Toby's protestation, but by a short cough---he dip'd the pen a second time into the inkhorn; and my uncle Toby, pointing with the end of his pipe as close to the top of the sheet at the left hand corner of it, as he could get it---the Corporal wrote down the word

She never, an' please your honour, enquires after it at all.

---God bless your honour! cried the Corporal---what has a woman's compassion to do with a wound upon the cap of a man's knee? had your honour's been shot into ten thousand splinters at the affair of Landen, Mrs. Wadman would have troubled her head as little about it as Bridget; because, added the Corporal, lowering his voice and speaking very distinctly, as he assigned his reason---

The Corporal had advanced too far to retire---in three words he told the rest---

<strong>There</strong>
will be just time, whilst my uncle Toby and Trim are walking to my father's, to inform you, that Mrs. Wadman had, some moons before this, made a confident of my mother; and that Mrs. Bridget, who had the burden of her own, as well as her mistress's secret to carry, had got happily delivered of both to Susannah behind the garden-wall.

provision should be made for continuing the race of so great, so exalted and godlike a Being as man---I am far from denying--- but philosophy speaks freely of every thing; and therefore I still think and do maintain it to be a pity, that it should be done by means of a passion which bends down the faculties, and turns all the wisdom, contemplations, and operations of the soul backwards---a passion, my dear, continued my father, addressing himself to my mother, which couples and equals wise men with fools, and makes us come out of our caverns and hiding-places more like satyrs and four-footed beasts than men.

<p>

I know it will be said, continued my father (availing himself of the
<em>Prolepsis</em>
) that in itself, and simply taken---like hunger, or thirst, or sleep---'tis an affair neither good or bad---or shameful or otherwise.


---Why then did the delicacy of
<em>Diogenes</em>
and
<em>Plato</em>
so recalcitrate against it? and wherefore, when we go about to make and plant a man, do we put out the candle? and for what reason is it, that all the parts thereof---the congredients ---the preparations---the instruments, and whatever serves thereto, are so held as to be conveyed to a cleanly mind by no language, translation, or periphrasis whatever?

you see, is glorious---and the weapons by which we do it are honourable---We march with them upon our shoulders--- We strut with them by our sides---We gild them---We carve them---We in-lay them---We enrich them--- Nay, if it be but a

cannon, we cast an ornament upon the breech of it.---

<p>
---My uncle Toby laid down his pipe to intercede for a better epithet--- and Yorick was rising up to batter the whole hypothesis to pieces--- 
</p> 
<p>
---When Obadiah broke into the middle of the room with a complaint, which cried out for an immediate hearing. 
</p> 
<p>
The case was this:

<br>

<p>

My father, whether by ancient custom of the manor, or as improprietor of the great tythes, was obliged to keep a Bull for the service of the Parish, and Obadiah had led his cow upon a
<em>pop-visit</em>
to him one day or other the preceeding summer---I say, one day or other---because as chance would have it, it was the day on which he was married to my father's house-maid---so one was a reckoning to the other.

Therefore when Obadiah's wife was brought to bed---Obadiah thanked God--- 
</p> 
<p>
---Now, said Obadiah, I shall have a calf: so Obadiah went daily to visit his cow. 
</p>

<br>

<p>
She'll calve on Monday---on Tuesday ---or Wednesday at the farthest--- 
</p> 
<p>
The cow did not calve---no---she'll not calve till next week---the cow put it off terribly---till at the end of the sixth week Obadiah's suspicions (like a good man's) fell upon the Bull. 
</p> 
<p>
Now the parish being very large, my father's Bull, to speak the truth of him, was no way equal to the department; he had, however, got himself, somehow or other, thrust into employment---and as he went through the business with a grave face, my father had a high opinion of him.

<p>
---Most of the townsmen, an' please your worship, quoth Obadiah, believe that 'tis all the Bull's fault--- 
</p> 
<p>
---But may not a cow be barren? replied my father, turning to Doctor Slop. 
</p> 
<p>
It never happens: said Dr. Slop, but the man's wife may have come before her time naturally enough---Prithee has the child hair upon his head?---added Dr. Slop--- 
</p> 
<p>
---It is as hairy as I am; said Obadiah. 

<ps>---Obadiah had not been shaved for three weeks---Wheu -- u ---- u -------- cried my father; beginning the sentence with an exclamatory </ps>

<ps>whistle---and so, brother Toby, this poor Bull of mine, who is as good a Bull as ever p-ss'd, and might have done for Europa herself in purer times ---had he but two legs less, might have been driven into Doctors Commons and lost his character---which to a Town Bull, brother Toby, is the very same thing as his life--- </ps>


</p> 
<p>
L--d! said my mother, what is all this story about?--- 
</p> 
<p>
A COCK and a BULL, said Yorick---And one of the best of its kind, I ever heard.

The author is here twice mistaken;---for

The second mistake is, that this

is not an author, but a drawing of a petrified child.


The account of this, published by

1580, may be seen at the end of

<em>Ce Foetus</em>
n'etoit pas plus grand que la pa&uacute;me de la main; mais son pere l'ayant &eacute;xamin&egrave; en qualit&egrave; de M&eacute;decin, &amp; ayant trouv&eacute; que c'etoit quelque chose de plus qu'un Embryon, le fit transporter tout vivant &agrave; Rapallo, ou il le fit voir &agrave; Jer&ocirc;me Bardi &amp; &agrave; d'autres Medecins du lieu.

On trouva qu'il ne lui manquoit rien d'essentiel a la vie; &amp; son pere pour faire voir un essai de son exp&eacute;rience, entreprit d'achever l'ouvrage de la Nature; &amp; de travailler a la formation de l'Enfant avec le m&ecirc;me artifice que celui dont on se sert pour faire &eacute;clorre les Poulets en Egypte. 
Il instruisit une Nourisse de tout ce qu'elle avoit &agrave; faire, &amp; ayant fait mettre son fil dans un four proprement accommod&egrave;, il reuissit &agrave; l'&eacute;lever et a lui faire prendre ses accroissemens necessaires, par l'uniformit&eacute; d'une chaleur) &eacute;trang&eacute;re mesur&eacute;e &eacute;xactement sur les d&eacute;gr&eacute;s d'un Thermom&eacute;tre, ou d'un autre instrument &eacute;quivalent.

</p> 
<p>

Mais quand on se represente que l'Enfant a vecu pres de quatre-vingts ans, &amp; que il a compos&eacute; quatre-vingts Ouvrages differents tous fruits d'une longue lecture,---il faut convenir que tout ce qui est incroyable n'est pas toujours faux, &amp; que la

Nous aurions quelque inter&ecirc;t, says

de montrer qu'il n' a rien de ridicule s'il &eacute;toit v&eacute;ritable, au moins dans le sens &eacute;nigmatique que

a t&acirc;ch&eacute; de lui donner.


Cet auteur dit que pour comprendre comme
<em>Lipse,</em>
a p&ucirc; composer un ouvrage le premier jour de sa vie, il faut s'imaginer, que ce premier jour n'est pas celui de sa naissance charnelle, mais celui au quel il a commenc&eacute; d'user de la raison; il veut que &ccedil;'ait &eacute;t&eacute; a l'age de
